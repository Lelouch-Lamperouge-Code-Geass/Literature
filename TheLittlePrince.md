If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.

If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"

我给你们讲关于小行星B612的这些细节，并且告诉你们它的编号，这是由于这些大人的缘故。这些大人们就爱数目字。当你对大人们讲起你的一个新朋友时，他们从来不向你提出实质性的问题。他们从来不讲：“他说话声音如何啊？他喜爱什么样的游戏啊？他是否收集蝴蝶标本呀？”他们却问你：“他多大年纪呀？弟兄几个呀？体重多少呀？他父亲挣多少钱呀？”他们以为这样才算了解朋友。如果你对大人们说：“我看到一幢用玫瑰色的砖盖成的漂亮的房子，它的窗户上有天竺葵，屋顶上还有鸽子…”他们怎么也想象不出这种房子有多么好。必须对他们说：“我看见了一幢价值十万法郎的房子。”那么他们就惊叫道：“多么漂亮的房子啊！”

"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
And a little later you added:
"You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…"
"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
But the little prince made no reply.

“一天，我看见过四十三次日落。”
过一会儿，你又说：
“你知道，当人们感到非常苦闷时，总是喜欢日落的。”
“一天四十三次，你怎么会这么苦闷？”
小王子没有回答。

"The thorns-- what use are they?"
The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"
"Oh!"
There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
__"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons…"__

“那么刺有什么用呢？”
小王子一旦提出了问题，从来不会放过。这个该死的螺丝使我很恼火，我于 是就随便回答了他一句：
“刺么，什么用都没有，这纯粹是花的恶劣表现。”
“噢！”
可是他沉默了一会儿之后，怀着不满的心情冲我说：
“我不信！花是弱小的、淳朴的，它们总是设法保护自己，以为有了刺就可 以显出自己的厉害……”

"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man-- he is a mushroom!"
“我到过一个星球，上面住着一个红脸先生。他从来没闻过一朵花。他从来 没有看过一颗星星。他什么人也没有喜欢过。除了算帐以外，他什么也没有做过。 他整天同你一样老是说：‘我有正经事，我是个严肃的人’。这使他傲气十足。 他简直不象是个人，他是个蘑菇。”

"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums? And if I know-- I, myself-- one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing-- Oh! You think that is not important!"

His face turned from white to red as he continued:

__"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there…'__ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened… And you think that is not important!"
“几百万年以来花儿都在制造着刺，几百万年以来羊仍然在吃花。要搞清楚 为什么花儿费那么大劲给自己制造没有什么用的刺，这难道不是正经事？难道羊 和花之间的战争不重要？这难道不比那个大胖子红脸先生的帐目更重要？如果我 认识一朵人世间唯一的花，只有我的星球上有它，别的地方都不存在，而一只小 羊胡里胡涂就这样把它一下子毁掉了，这难道不重要？”

他的脸气得发红，然后又接着说道：

“如果有人爱上了在这亿万颗星星中独一无二的一株花，当他看着这些星星 的时候，这就足以使他感到幸福。他可以自言自语地说：‘我的那朵花就在其中 的一颗星星上……’，但是如果羊吃掉了这朵花，对他来说，好象所有的星星一下 子全都熄灭了一样！这难道也不重要吗？！”


The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her petals one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies. It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear. Oh, yes! She was a coquettish creature! And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.
小王子感觉到从这个花苞 中一定会出现一个奇迹。然而这朵花藏在它那绿茵茵的房间中用了很长的时间来 打扮自己。她精心选择着她将来的颜色，慢慢腾腾地妆饰着，一片片地搭配着她 的花瓣，她不愿象虞美人那样一出世就满脸皱纹。她要让自己带着光艳夺目的丽 姿来到世间。是的，她是非常爱俏的。她用好些好些日子天仙般地梳妆打扮。然 后，在一天的早晨，恰好在太阳升起的时候，她开放了。

“晚上您得把我保护好。你这地方太冷。在这里住得不好，我原来住的那个 地方……”
但她没有说下去。她来的时候是粒种子。她哪里见过什么别的世界。她叫人 发现她是在凑一个如此不太高明的谎话，她有点羞怒，咳嗽了两三声。她的这一 招是要小王子处于有过失的地位，她说道：
“屏风呢？”
有一天他告诉我说：“我不该听信她的话，绝不该听信那些花儿的话，看看 花，闻闻它就得了。我的那朵花使我的星球芳香四溢，可我不会享受它。关于老 虎爪子的事，本应该使我产生同情，却反而使我恼火……”
他还告诉我说：
“我那时什么也不懂！我应该根据她的行为，而不是根据她的话来判断她。 她使我的生活芬芳多彩，我真不该离开她跑出来。我本应该猜出在她那令人爱怜 的花招后面所隐藏的温情。花是多么自相矛盾！我当时太年青，还不懂得爱她。”
"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from--"
But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na飗e untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
"The screen?"
"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me…"
Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same.
So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."
And he continued his confidences:
__"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her… I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her…"__


 And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears.
"Goodbye," he said to the flower.
But she made no answer.
"Goodbye," he said again.
The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy…"
He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you-- you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy… let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."
"But the wind--"
"My cold is not so bad as all that… the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."
"But the animals--"
"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies-- and the caterpillars-- who will call upon me? You will be far away… as for the large animals-- I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
And, naively, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"
For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower…
当他最后一次浇花时，准备把她好好珍藏起来。他发觉自己要哭出来。
“再见了。”他对花儿说道。
可是花儿没有回答他。
“再见了。”他又说了一遍。
花儿咳嗽了一阵。但并不是由于感冒。
她终于对他说道：“我方才真蠢。请你原谅我。希望你能幸福。” 花儿对他毫不抱怨，他感到很惊讶。他举着罩子，不知所措地伫立在那里。 他不明白她为什么会这样温柔恬静。
“的确，我爱你。”花儿对他说道：“但由于我的过错，你一点也没有理会。 这丝毫不重要。不过，你也和我一样的蠢。希望你今后能幸福。把罩子放在一边 吧，我用不着它了。”
“要是风来了怎么办？”
“我的感冒并不那么重……夜晚的凉风对我倒有好处。我是一朵花。”
“要是有虫子野兽呢？……”
“我要是想认识蝴蝶，经不起两三只尺蠖是不行的。据说这是很美的。不然 还有谁来看我呢？你就要到远处去了。至于说大动物，我并不怕，我有爪子。”
于是，她天真地显露出她那四根刺，随后又说道：
“别这么磨蹭了。真烦人！你既然决定离开这儿，那么，快走吧！”
她是怕小王子看见她在哭。她是一朵非常骄傲的花……


"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
And the little prince asked himself:
"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.
当他看见小王子时，喊了起来：
“啊，来了一个臣民。”
小王子思量着：“他从来也没有见过我，怎么会认识我呢？”
他哪里知道，在那些国王的眼里，世界是非常简单的：所有的人都是臣民。


Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
“一点也不错，”国王接着说，“向每个人提出的要求应该是他们所能做到 的。权威首先应该建立在理性的基础上。如果命令你的老百姓去投海，他们非起来革命不可。我的命令是合理的，所以我有权要别人服从。”

"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
“喔唷！一个崇拜我的人来拜访了！”这个爱虚荣的人一见到小王子，老远 就叫喊起来。在那些爱虚荣的人眼里，别人都成了他们的崇拜者。

"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.
"I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.
"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
"So that I may forget," replied the tippler.
"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.
"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
"Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.
"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.
And the little prince went away, puzzled.

“你在干什么？”小王子问酒鬼，这个酒鬼默默地坐在那里，面前有一堆酒 瓶子，有的装着酒，有的是空的。
“我喝酒。”他阴沉忧郁地回答道。
“你为什么喝酒？”小王子问道。
“为了忘却。”酒鬼回答。
小王子已经有些可怜酒鬼。他问道：“忘却什么呢？”
酒鬼垂下脑袋坦白道：“为了忘却我的羞愧。”
“你羞愧什么呢？”小王子很想救助他。
“我羞愧我喝酒。”酒鬼说完以后就再也不开口了。
小王子迷惑不解地离开了。


"I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars…"
The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
“我有一朵花，我每天都给她浇水。我还有三座火山，我每星期把它们全都 打扫一遍。连死火山也打扫。谁知道它会不会再复活。我拥有火山和花，这对我的火山有益处，对我的花也有益处。但是你对星星并没有用处……”
实业家张口结舌无言以对。于是小王子就走了。

"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."
He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:
"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people…"
What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
“这个人一定会被其他那些人，国王呀，爱虚荣的呀，酒鬼呀，实业家呀， 所瞧不起。可是唯有他不使我感到荒唐可笑。这可能是因为他所关心的是别的事，而不是他自己。”
他惋惜地叹了口气，并且又对自己说道：
“本来这是我唯一可以和他交成朋友的人。可是他的星球确实太小了，住不 下两个人……”
小王子没有勇气承认的是：他留恋这颗令人赞美的星星，特别是因为在那里 每二十四小时就有一千四百四十次日落！


————"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…"————
“一点不错，”狐狸说。“对我来说，你还只是一个小男孩，就像其他千万 个小男孩一样。我不需要你。你也同样用不着我。对你来说，我也不过是一只狐狸，和其他千万只狐狸一样。但是，如果你驯服了我，我们就互相不可缺少了。 对我来说，你就是世界上唯一的了；我对你来说，也是世界上唯一的了。”



————"My life is very monotonous," the fox said. "I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life . I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not ea t bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me bac k the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…"————
The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.
"Please-- tame me!" he said.
"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…"
"What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me-- like that-- in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But yo u will sit a little closer to me, every day…"
The next day the little prince came back.
"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you… One must observe the proper rites…"
"What is a rite?" asked the little prince.
"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
__So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near--
"Ah," said the fox, "I shall cry."
"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…"
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.
"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince.
"Yes, that is so," said the fox.
"Then it has done you no good at all!"
"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields."__ And then he added:
"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
__"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."
And the roses were very much embarrassed.
"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you-- the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.__
And he went back to meet the fox.
"Goodbye," he said.
"Goodbye," said the fox. __"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."__
"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
__"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."__
"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.
__"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose…"
"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.__

“我的生活很单调。我捕捉鸡，而人又捕捉我。所有的鸡全都一样，所有的 人也全都一样。因此，我感到有些厌烦了。但是，如果你要是驯服了我，我的生活就一定会是欢快的。我会辨认出一种与众不同的脚步声。其他的脚步声会使我 躲到地下去，而你的脚步声就会象音乐一样让我从洞里走出来。再说，你看！你看到那边的麦田没有？我不吃面包，麦子对我来说，一点用也没有。我对麦田无 动于衷。而这，真使人扫兴。但是，你有着金黄色的头发。那么，一旦你驯服了我，这就会十分美妙。麦子，是金黄色的，它就会使我想起你。而且，我甚至会 喜欢那风吹麦浪的声音……”“请你驯服我吧！”他说。
“我是很愿意的。”小王子回答道，“可我的时间不多了。我还要去寻找朋 友，还有许多事物要了解。”
“只有被驯服了的事物，才会被了解。”狐狸说，“人不会再有时间去了解 任何东西的。他们总是到商人那里去购买现成的东西。因为世界上还没有购买朋友的商店，所以人也就没有朋友。如果你想要一个朋友，那就驯服我吧！”
“那么应当做些什么呢？”小王子说。
“应当非常耐心。”狐狸回答道，“开始你就这样坐在草丛中，坐得离我稍 微远些。我用眼角瞅着你，你什么也不要说。话语是误会的根源。但是，每天，你坐得靠我更近些……”
第二天，小王子又来了。
“最好还是在原来的那个时间来。”狐狸说道，“比如说，你下午四点钟来， 那么从三点钟起，我就开始感到幸福。时间越临近，我就越感到幸福。到了四点钟的时候，我就会坐立不安；我就会发现幸福的代价。但是，如果你随便什么时 候来，我就不知道在什么时候该准备好我的心情……应当有一定的仪式。”
“仪式是什么？”小王子问道。
“这也是一种早已被人忘却了的事。”狐狸说，“它就是使某一天与其他日 子不同，使某一时刻与其他时刻不同。比如说，我的那些猎人就有一种仪式。他们每星期四都和村子里的姑娘们跳舞。于是，星期四就是一个美好的日子！我可 以一直散步到葡萄园去。如果猎人们什么时候都跳舞，天天又全都一样，那么我也就没有假日了。”
就这样，小王子驯服了狐狸。当出发的时刻就快要来到时：
“啊！”狐狸说，“我一定会哭的。”
“这是你的过错，”小王子说，“我本来并不想给你任何痛苦，可你却要我驯 服你……”
“是这样的。”狐狸说。
“你可就要哭了！”小王子说。
“当然罗。”狐狸说。
“那么你什么好处也没得到。”
“由于麦子颜色的缘故，我还是得到了好处。”狐狸说。
然后，他又接着说。
“再去看看那些玫瑰花吧。你一定会明白，你的那朵是世界上独一无二的玫 瑰。你回来和我告别时，我再赠送给你一个秘密。”
于是小王子又去看那些玫瑰。
“你们一点也不象我的那朵玫瑰，你们还什么都不是呢！”小王子对她们说。 “没有人驯服过你们，你们也没有驯服过任何人。你们就象我的狐狸过去那样，它那时只是和千万只别的狐狸一样的一只狐狸。但是，我现在已经把它当成了我 的朋友，于是它现在就是世界上独一无二的了。”
这时，那些玫瑰花显得十分难堪。
“你们很美，但你们是空虚的。”小王子仍然在对她们说，“没有人能为你 们去死。当然罗，我的那朵玫瑰花，一个普通的过路人以为她和你们一样。可是，她单独一朵就比你们全体更重要，因为她是我浇灌的。因为她是我放在花罩中的。 因为她是我用屏风保护起来的。因为她身上的毛虫（除了留下两三只为了变蝴蝶而外）是我除灭的。因为我倾听过她的怨艾和自诩，甚至有时我聆听着她的沉默。 因为她是我的玫瑰。”
“再见了。”小王子说道。
“再见。”狐狸说。“喏，这就是我的秘密。很简单：只有用心才能看得清。 实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。”
“实质性的东西，用眼睛是看不见的。”小王子重复着这句话，以便能把它 记在心间。
“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间，这才使你的玫瑰变得如此重要。”
“正因为你为你的玫瑰花费了时间……”小王子又重复着，要使自己记住这些。
“人们已经忘记了这个道理，”狐狸说，“可是，你不应该忘记它。你现在 要对你驯服过的一切负责到底。你要对你的玫瑰负责……”
“我要对我的玫瑰负责……”小王子又重复着……


As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: "What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…"
As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: __"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…"__ And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…
And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.
小王子睡觉了，我就把他抱在怀里，又重新上路了。我很激动。就好象抱着 一个脆弱的宝贝。就好象在地球上没有比这更脆弱的了。我借着月光看着这惨白的面额，这双紧闭的眼睛，这随风飘动的绺绺头发，这时我对自己说道：“我所 看到的仅仅是外表。最重要的是看不见的……”
由于看到他稍稍张开的嘴唇露出一丝微笑，我又自言自语地说：“在这个熟 睡了的小王子身上，使我非常感动的，是他对他那朵花的忠诚，是在他心中闪烁的那朵玫瑰花的形象。这朵玫瑰花，即使在小王子睡着了的时候，也象一盏灯的 火焰一样在他身上闪耀着光辉……”这时，我就感觉到他更加脆弱。应该保护灯焰：一阵风就可能把它吹灭……
于是，就这样走着，我在黎明时发现了水井。



And I understood what he had been looking for.
I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received
我把水桶提到他的嘴边。他闭着眼睛喝水。就象节日一般舒适愉快。这水远 不只是一种饮料，它是披星戴月走了许多路才找到的，是在辘轳的歌声中，经过我双臂的努力得来的。它象是一件礼品慰藉着心田。在我小的时候，圣诞树的灯 光，午夜的弥撒的音乐，甜蜜的微笑，这一切都使圣诞节时我收到的礼品辉映着幸福的光彩。

"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…"
“眼睛是什么也看不见的。应该用心去寻找。”

"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers…"
“这就象花一样。如果你爱上了一朵生长在一颗星星上的花，那么夜间，你 看着天空就感到甜蜜愉快。所有的星星上都好象开着花。”

"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems . For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You-- you alone-- will have the stars as no one else has them--
"What are you trying to say?"
"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… you-- only you-- will have stars that can laugh!"
“人们眼里的星星并不都一样。对旅行的人来说，星星是向导。对别的人来 说，星星只是些小亮光。对另外一些学者来说，星星就是他们探讨的学问。对我所遇见的那个实业家来说，星星是金钱。但是，所有这些星星都不会说话。你呢， 你的那些星星将是任何人都不曾有过的……”
“你说的是什么？”
“夜晚，当你望着天空的时候，既然我就住在其中一颗星星上，既然我在其 中一颗星星上笑着，那么对你来说，就好象所有的星星都在笑，那么你将看到的
星星就是会笑的星星！”

"You understand… it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."
“你明白，路很远。我不能带着这付身躯走。它太重了。”
