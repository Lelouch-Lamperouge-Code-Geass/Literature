* Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip  of  the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four  feet  ten  in  one sock.  She  was  Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In  point  of  fact, there  might  have  been  no  Lolita  at  all had I not loved, one summer, a
certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.  Oh  when?  About  as many  years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the  jury,  exhibit  number  one  is  what  the
seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.   洛丽塔，我生命之光，我欲念之火。我的罪恶，我的灵魂。洛一丽一塔：舌尖向上，分三步，从上颚往下轻轻落在牙齿上。洛。丽。塔。 在早晨，她就是洛，普普通通的洛，穿一只袜子，身高四尺十寸。穿上宽松裤时，她是洛拉。在学校里她是多丽。 正式签名时她是多洛雷斯。可在我的怀里，她永远是洛丽塔。 在她之前还有过别人吗？有的，确实有的。事实上，可能从来也没有什么洛丽塔，要不是我在一个夏天曾爱上了一个女童。在海边一片王子的领地。在什么时候？就是那一年，洛丽塔还有多少年才降临世间，我的岁数就有多少。你放心，杀人犯总能写出一手妙文。陪审团的女士们、先生们，第一件证物正是被六翼天使，那个误传的、简单的、羽翼高贵的六翼天使所嫉妒的。且看这段纠缠不清的痛苦心史吧。

* One night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family. In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the  ruins  of  a  low  stone  wall. Through  the  darkness  and  the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of  sensitive  memory, appear  to  me  now like playing cards--presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner  of her  parted  lips  and  the  hot  lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves;  that  vibrant sky  seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its  own.  Her legs,  her  lovely  live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it  sought,  a  dreamy  and  eerie  expression,  half-pleasure, half-pain,  came  over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to  kiss  me,  her  head would  bend  with  a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again;  and her  quivering  mouth,  distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my  face.  She  would  try  to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine; then  my  darling  would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on  her  open  mouth,  while  with  a generosity  that  was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion. 在别墅后面一片神经质的、叶片柔舒的含羞草丛中，我们找到一个隐身高台，在一面断墙矮垣上。透过暗夜温柔的树木，我们能看见亮灯的窗户上斑驳的图案，那图案被感觉记忆的彩色墨汁重新唤起，现在浮现眼前，象纸牌一样——因为推测到我们的敌人正忙于打桥牌。她颤抖着，痉挛着，我吻着她张开的唇角和火烫的耳垂。一群星星在我们头顶、在细长的树叶剪影中闪着幽昧的光；那充满生命力的天空赤裸着，象她轻软薄罩裙下的身体。我在天空里看见她的脸，清晰异常，仿佛放射着它自身微弱的光焰。她的双腿，她美丽、健康的双腿，合得不很紧，当我的手放在它要寻觅的位置上时，一种梦幻般怪异的表情，半是愉快，半是痛苦，显现在两张孩子气的脸上。她坐得比我高一点儿，每次她独自兴奋若狂便前来吻我，她的头梦幻般轻柔地、微微弯斜，那动作几乎是哀怨的，她裸露的膝盖紧夹住我的手腕，又松塌下去，她的颤栗的嘴扭曲了，象受了一种神秘药性的刺激，朝我的脸颊靠过来抽吸一口气。她上来便会企图用她干涩的唇摩挲我的，想摆脱那爱的痛楚，而后我的爱又会躲开，头发神经质地一甩，接着再幽幽地靠近，让我的唇寄满她微张的小嘴，我已准备把一切慷溉地交与她，我的心、我的喉、我的五脏六腑，我把我感情的宝杖交给她抓在她笨拙的掌中。

*  There my beauty lay down  on  her stomach, showing me, showing the thousand eyes wide open in my eyed blood, her slightly raised shoulder blades, and  the  bloom  along  the incurvation  of  her  spine,  and  the  swellings  of her tense narrow nates clothed in black, and the seaside of her schoolgirl  thighs.  Silently,  the seventh-grader enjoyed her green-red-blue comics. She was the loveliest nymphet green-red-blue Priap himself could think up. As I looked on, through prismatic layers of light, dry-lipped, focusing my lust and rocking slightly under my newspaper, I felt that my perception of her, if properly concentrated upon, might be sufficient to have me attain a beggar's bliss immediately; but, like some predator that prefers a moving prey to a motionless one, I planned to have this pitiful attainment coincide with the various girlish movements she made now and then as she read, such as trying to scratch the middle of her back and revealing a stippled armpit--but fat Haze suddenly spoiled everything by turning to me and asking me for a light, and starting a make-believe conversation about a fake book by some popular fraud. 我的美人俯身躺下了，向我，向我圆睁充血的一千只眼睛展示她微微抬起的肩胛骨，展示她沿着脊骨的弯曲呈现的花蕾，展示她紧绷绷、窄窄的臀穿在黑衣里显示出的膨胀，还有她那双女学生式的大腿。静静地，这位七年纪的学生正欣赏由绿一红一蓝绘成的连环画。她就是绿一红一蓝的画家本人所能想到的最迷人的性感少女。我目不转睛、嘴唇干涩，透过三梭形光层调节我的欲望，并在报纸下轻轻震动，我若全神惯注，我感到对她的感觉会立朝使我心旌摇曳；但是，正象许多掠夺者宁肯要跑着的猎物而不要静止的，我想让这次可鄙的收获能与一次千姿百态的少女娇动同步发生，这种动作在她看图画时时有出现，比如试图挠挠后背，抬起一只臂，露出点点细毛的腋窝——但肥胖的黑兹太太突然间破坏了一切，她转向我，向我要火，然后就大谈一位颇受欢迎的文化骗子的一部杜撰作品。

* A poet ю mes heures, I composed a madrigal to the soot-black lashes of her pale-gray vacant eyes, to the five asymmetrical freckles on her bobbed nose, to the blond down of her brown limbs; but I tore it up and cannot recall it today. Only in the tritest of terms (diary resumed) can I describe Lo's features: I might say her hair is auburn, and her lips as red as licked red candy, the lower one prettily plump--oh, that I were a lady writer who could have her pose naked in a naked light! But instead I am lanky, big-boned, wooly-chested Humbert Humbert, with thick black eyebrows and a queer accent, and a cesspoolful of rotting monsters behind his slow boyish smile. And neither is she the fragile child of a feminine novel. What drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet--of every nymphet, perhaps; this mixture in my Lolita of tender dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity, stemming from the snub-nosed cuteness of ads and magazine pictures, from the blurry pinkness of adolescent maidservants in the Old Country (smelling of crushed daisies and sweat); and from very young harlots disguised as children in provincial brothels; and then again, all this gets mixed up with the exquisite stainless tenderness seeping through the musk and the mud, through the dirt and the death, oh God, oh God. And what is most singular is that she, this Lolita, my Lolita, has individualized the writer's ancient lust, so that above and over everything there is--Lolita.  作为我的时代的诗人，我写了一首抒情短诗，为她灰蒙蒙茫然的眼睛上那对膝黑的睫毛，为她短截的鼻子上那不对称的五个雀斑，为她棕色肢体上遍布的黑色软毛；但我把它撕碎了，今天已想不起来。我只能用最刻板的语言(日记可以重写)来描述洛的特征：我应该说她的头发是赤褐色的，她的唇红得象舔过的红色蜜饯，下唇凸出甚为漂亮——噢，如果我是个女性作家，我就可以让她在赤裸的灯光下作出裸体的姿态！然而，我却是瘦高个、骨节宽粗、长满绵羊般胸毛的亨伯特·亨伯特，浓黑的眉毛，奇特的口音，在他小伙子式优雅的微笑后面，潜藏的是一个污水沟般腐臭的魔鬼。而她，也不是一部女性作品中脆弱的孩子。使我失去理智的是这个性感少女的二重性——可能也是所有性感少女的；我的洛丽塔身上混和了温柔如梦的孩子气与一种怪异的粗野，是从广告和滑稽画片上那些狮子鼻的做作态学来的；是从“旧时代”弥散着辗碎了的雏菊和汗味的成年仆役身上那种模糊不清的左倾思想学来的；是从地方妓院里那些非常年轻、却还要装成孩子的妓女那儿学来的；而后，所有这一切又与白璧无瑕无以伦比的温柔混杂在一起，渗入麝香味的草丛和泥土之中，渗透尘埃和死亡，噢，上帝，噢，上帝啊，最特别的是她，这个洛丽塔，我的洛丽塔，已经控制了作者的古老欲望，因此在一切的一切之上和之后就只有——洛丽塔。

*  If I dwell at some length on the tremors and groupings of that distant night, it is because I insist upon proving that I am not, and never was, and never could have been, a brutal scoundrel. The gentle and dreamy regions though which I crept were the patrimonies of poets--not crime's prowling ground. Had I reached my goal, my ecstasy would have been all softness, a case of internal combustion of which she would hardly have felt the heat, even if she were wide awake. But I still hoped she might gradually be engulfed in a completeness of stupor that would allow me to taste more than a glimmer of her. And so, in between tentative approximations, with a confusion of perception metamorphosing her into eyespots of moonlight or a fluffy flowering bush, I would dream I regained consciousness, dream I lay in wait. 我之所以最终能滞留在兴奋的颤栗、以及对那遥远夜晚的摸索中，是因为我坚持要证明我现在不是、从来也不是、将来也不可能是一个兽性恶棍。我偷行过的那个温和朦胧的境地是诗人的遗产——不是罪犯潜巡的地狱。如果我够到了我的目标，我的狂热就会全部化作柔情，是一种即使她清醒时也感觉不到其热力的内心燃烧。但是我仍然希望她能渐渐陷入彻底的昏迷，这样我便可以体味更多，而不仅仅是她的晶莹。因此在趋向靠近当中，因为混乱的感觉将她变形为月光透下的眼状斑点或是覆满松软茸草、鲜花盛开的灌木，我于是梦见我重获知觉，梦见我躺卧在期待中。
