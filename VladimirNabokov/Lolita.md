* Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. Lo-lee-ta: the tip  of  the tongue taking a trip of three steps down the palate to tap, at three, on the teeth. Lo. Lee. Ta. She was Lo, plain Lo, in the morning, standing four  feet  ten  in  one sock.  She  was  Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Dolores on the dotted line. But in my arms she was always Lolita.Did she have a precursor? She did, indeed she did. In  point  of  fact, there  might  have  been  no  Lolita  at  all had I not loved, one summer, a
certain initial girl-child. In a princedom by the sea.  Oh  when?  About  as many  years before Lolita was born as my age was that summer. You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gentlemen of the  jury,  exhibit  number  one  is  what  the
seraphs, the misinformed, simple, noble-winged seraphs, envied. Look at this tangle of thorns.   洛丽塔，我生命之光，我欲念之火。我的罪恶，我的灵魂。洛一丽一塔：舌尖向上，分三步，从上颚往下轻轻落在牙齿上。洛。丽。塔。 在早晨，她就是洛，普普通通的洛，穿一只袜子，身高四尺十寸。穿上宽松裤时，她是洛拉。在学校里她是多丽。 正式签名时她是多洛雷斯。可在我的怀里，她永远是洛丽塔。 在她之前还有过别人吗？有的，确实有的。事实上，可能从来也没有什么洛丽塔，要不是我在一个夏天曾爱上了一个女童。在海边一片王子的领地。在什么时候？就是那一年，洛丽塔还有多少年才降临世间，我的岁数就有多少。你放心，杀人犯总能写出一手妙文。陪审团的女士们、先生们，第一件证物正是被六翼天使，那个误传的、简单的、羽翼高贵的六翼天使所嫉妒的。且看这段纠缠不清的痛苦心史吧。

* One night, she managed to deceive the vicious vigilance of her family. In a nervous and slender-leaved mimosa grove at the back of their villa we found a perch on the  ruins  of  a  low  stone  wall. Through  the  darkness  and  the tender trees we could see the arabesques of lighted windows which, touched up by the colored inks of  sensitive  memory, appear  to  me  now like playing cards--presumably because a bridge game was keeping the enemy busy. She trembled and twitched as I kissed the corner  of her  parted  lips  and  the  hot  lobe of her ear. A cluster of stars palely glowed above us, between the silhouettes of long thin leaves;  that  vibrant sky  seemed as naked as she was under her light frock. I saw her face in the sky, strangely distinct, as if it emitted a faint radiance of its  own.  Her legs,  her  lovely  live legs, were not too close together, and when my hand located what it  sought,  a  dreamy  and  eerie  expression,  half-pleasure, half-pain,  came  over those childish features. She sat a little higher than I, and whenever in her solitary ecstasy she was led to  kiss  me,  her  head would  bend  with  a sleepy, soft, drooping movement that was almost woeful, and her bare knees caught and compressed my wrist, and slackened again;  and her  quivering  mouth,  distorted by the acridity of some mysterious potion, with a sibilant intake of breath came near to my  face.  She  would  try  to relieve the pain of love by first roughly rubbing her dry lips against mine; then  my  darling  would draw away with a nervous toss of her hair, and then again come darkly near and let me feed on  her  open  mouth,  while  with  a generosity  that  was ready to offer her everything, my heart, my throat, my entrails, I have her to hold in her awkward fist the scepter of my passion. 在别墅后面一片神经质的、叶片柔舒的含羞草丛中，我们找到一个隐身高台，在一面断墙矮垣上。透过暗夜温柔的树木，我们能看见亮灯的窗户上斑驳的图案，那图案被感觉记忆的彩色墨汁重新唤起，现在浮现眼前，象纸牌一样——因为推测到我们的敌人正忙于打桥牌。她颤抖着，痉挛着，我吻着她张开的唇角和火烫的耳垂。一群星星在我们头顶、在细长的树叶剪影中闪着幽昧的光；那充满生命力的天空赤裸着，象她轻软薄罩裙下的身体。我在天空里看见她的脸，清晰异常，仿佛放射着它自身微弱的光焰。她的双腿，她美丽、健康的双腿，合得不很紧，当我的手放在它要寻觅的位置上时，一种梦幻般怪异的表情，半是愉快，半是痛苦，显现在两张孩子气的脸上。她坐得比我高一点儿，每次她独自兴奋若狂便前来吻我，她的头梦幻般轻柔地、微微弯斜，那动作几乎是哀怨的，她裸露的膝盖紧夹住我的手腕，又松塌下去，她的颤栗的嘴扭曲了，象受了一种神秘药性的刺激，朝我的脸颊靠过来抽吸一口气。她上来便会企图用她干涩的唇摩挲我的，想摆脱那爱的痛楚，而后我的爱又会躲开，头发神经质地一甩，接着再幽幽地靠近，让我的唇寄满她微张的小嘴，我已准备把一切慷溉地交与她，我的心、我的喉、我的五脏六腑，我把我感情的宝杖交给她抓在她笨拙的掌中。
