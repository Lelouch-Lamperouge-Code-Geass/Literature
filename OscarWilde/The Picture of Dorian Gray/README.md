# Chapter 01

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

From the corner of the divan of Persian saddlebags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect,1 and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. 

The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.

画室里弥漫着浓浓的玫瑰花香，的轻风拂过园中的树木，开着的门便送来了馥郁的紫丁香味，或是满枝粉红色花的荆棘的清香。

亨利．沃登勋爵躺在波斯皮革做的长沙发上，习惯地抽着烟，数不清是第几根了。从沙发的角落望出去，正好看得见像蜜一样甜，又如蜜一般黄的金莲花在闪烁。抖动着的树枝，似乎很难承载花儿火焰一般的美。飞鸟的奇异影子，不时掠过掩着大窗的柞蚕丝绸窗帘，造成了瞬间的日本式效果，令他想起东京那些脸色苍白如玉的画家们。这些人运用必要的静态艺术手段，力求表达一种快速的动感。

蜜蜂沉闷地嗡嗡叫着，穿行在没有刈过、长得很高的青草之间，或是单调地一味围着满地忍冬那金黄色、灰蒙蒙的花蕊打转，似乎使这沉寂愈发压抑了。伦敦模糊的喧闹声，就像远处一架风琴奏出的低音。

房子中间直立的画架上，夹着一张画像，画像中的年轻人美貌绝伦，跟真人一般大。画像前面不远的地方，坐着画家本人，巴兹尔·霍尔华德。几年前，他突然失踪，引起公众的极大兴趣，也招徕了很多奇怪的猜测。

画家打量着他如此巧妙地再现在艺术中的优雅俊秀的形象，满意的笑容闪过脸庞，似乎正要在那儿停留下来。但他突然惊跳起来，闭上了眼睛，手指捂住眼帘，仿佛想把某个奇怪的梦捂进脑子，生怕自己从梦中醒来。

Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.
忠贞不贰的人只知道爱的小零小碎，而见异思迁者才懂得爱的大悲大痛。

# Chapter 02

‘There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr Gray. All influence is immoral – immoral from the scientific point of view.’

‘Why?’

‘Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly – that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion – these are the two things that govern us. And yet –’

“世上并没有好影响这样的东西，格雷先生。一切影响都是不道德的——从科学的观点看，不道德。”

“为什么？”

“因为去影响一个人就是把自己的灵魂给了他。他便不会按天性去思考，或者按天性燃起自己的激情。他的美德不真实。他的罪过，要是有的话，也是借来的。他成了别人的音乐的回声，成了这么个演员，扮演着剧本中没有为他而写的角色。生活的目的在于自我发展。充分实现自己的天性——是我们每个人来到世间的目的。如今，人们倒怕起自己来了，忘记了他们的最高职责，也就是对自己应负的责任。当然，他们很慈悲，让饿肚子的吃饱，让要饭的有衣穿。但他们自己的灵魂却在挨饿，赤裸裸一无遮拦。我们的民族失去了勇气，也许从来就并未真有过勇气。害怕社会是道德的基础，害怕上帝是宗教的秘密，就是这两者支配着我们。但是——”

‘And yet,’ continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days,3 ‘I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream – I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal – to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives.4 We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame –’

“但是，”亨利勋爵又往下说，嗓子低沉悦耳。同时他还很有风度地挥了一下手，那是他的一个典型动作，在伊顿公学念书的日子就有了。“我相信，人的一生要是活得充分彻底。人要是抒发一切感情，表达一切思想，实现所有的梦想——我相信，世界将沉浸于新的喜悦之中，于是我们会忘掉中世纪时代的一切弊病，回到希腊的理想中去——也许是一种比希腊的理想更好、更丰富的东西。但我们中的最勇敢分子也害怕自己。那种野蛮自残式的过分克己，不幸还存在，使生活大为减色。我们因为自我克制而遭到了惩罚。想要压制的每个冲动都在头脑中酝酿着，并毒害我们。肉体一旦犯罪，便与罪孽无·缘，因为行动是一种净化的方式。除了回忆的愉悦，悔恨的奢侈，什么都没有留下。摆脱诱惑的惟一办法是向诱惑投降。倘若抵制，灵魂就会得病，病因便是渴望自己所不允的东西，企求那些可怕的法律使其变得可怕和非法的东西。据说，世上的伟大都发自脑袋。在脑袋里，也只有在脑袋里，产生了世间的大罪大恶。你，格雷先生，拿你自己来说吧，你的青年时代像玫瑰一样红，少年时代像玫瑰一样白，你曾产生过让自己害怕的激情，有过令你胆战心惊的念头，做过白梦和夜间梦，只要一想起这些梦来，你会满脸愧色——”

For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips, and eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to him – words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them – had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.

Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?

Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known it?

大约有十分钟，他一动不动地站在那里，嘴巴张开着，眼睛异样地明亮。他模糊地意识到，内心正接受着一种全新的影响，而这种影响似乎来自于他自己。巴兹尔的朋友同他说的几句话——随口说说的，毫无疑问。话中不乏刻意的悖论——拨动了某根秘密的心弦，这根心弦以前从未触及过，此刻却在奇怪地搏动着。

音乐曾经如此打动过他，无数次折磨过他，但音乐表达得并不清晰，它在我们心里创造的不是一个新世界，而是另一种混乱。话语呀！只不过话语！它多么可怕！多么清楚，多么生动，多么残酷！你无法逃避话语，它蕴含着多么微妙的魔力，似乎能使无形的东西变成有形，似乎自身具有一种音乐，像提琴和诗琴一样动听。而只不过是话语！还有比话语更真实的吗？

不错，年少时他有很多东西不懂，此刻他懂了，忽地觉得生活的色彩像火一样红，仿佛自己向来就在火中行走。但为什么以前一直没有觉察呢？

Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him, and put his hand upon his shoulder. ‘You are quite right to do that,’ he murmured. ‘Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.’

The lad started and drew back. He was bare-headed, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely-chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.

‘Yes,’ continued Lord Henry, ‘that is one of the great secrets of life – to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.’

Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.

亨利勋爵走出画室，到了花园里。发现道连·格雷把脸埋在硕大凉爽的紫丁香花丛中，喝酒似的拚命吸吮着香气。他走近道连，把手搭在他肩上。“你做得很对，”他低声说，“只有感官才能拯救灵魂，就像只有灵魂才能拯救感官一样。”

小伙子吃了一惊，往后退去。他头上什么也没有戴，树叶撩起了他不听话的鬈发，缠住了金色的发丝。他像一个突然被叫醒的人那样，露出了恐惧的眼神，轮廓分明的鼻孔颤动着，某根隐蔽的神经震撼了他鲜红的嘴唇，弃得它抖个不停。

“是呀，”亨利勋爵继续说，“那是生活的一大秘密——用感官来，拯救灵魂，用灵魂来拯救感官。你是一个了不起的创造。你知道的比你自己设想的要多，就像你知道的比你想要知道的要少一样。”道连·格雷皱了皱眉，转过头去。他禁不住喜欢起身旁这个高高的、风度翩翩的年轻人来。那橄榄色浪漫的脸和疲惫的表情使他兴味盎然。在慢悠悠低沉的嗓音里，有一种极为动人的东西。甚至那白皙、冰凉、花一样的双手，也有一种奇妙的魅力。说话时，他的手像音乐一样流动着，似乎有着自己的语言。但他害怕他，并为害怕而感到惭愧。为什么得让一个陌生人来披露自己的心灵呢？他与巴兹尔相识已有几个月了，但他们之间的并没有改变他。突然问，生活中闯进了一个人，似乎给他揭示了生活的秘密。而这又有什么可怕呢？自己又不是个小学生，要是害怕，那可太荒唐了。

‘It should matter everything to you, Mr Gray.’

‘Why?’

‘Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.’

‘I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.’

‘No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so?… You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray. Don’t frown. You have. And Beauty is a form of Genius – is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t smile.… People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial. That may be so. But at least it is not so superficial as Thought is. To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible…. Yes, Mr Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly…. Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing…. A new Hedonism – that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season…. The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last – such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!’

“这应当与你息息相关，格雷先生。”

“为什么？”

“因为你享受着最了不起的青春，而青春是值得拥有的。”

“我并没有那种感觉，亨利勋爵。”

“不，你只是现在没有罢了。某一天，等你垂垂老矣，满脸皱纹，丑陋不堪的时候，等思考使你歇顶，把线条刻上你前额的时候，等激情把它可怕的火焰烙上你嘴唇的时候，你会感觉到的，你会强烈地感觉到。现在呢，无论你走到哪里，你会让世界倾倒，难道你能永远这样吗？……你有一张极其漂亮的面孔，格雷先生。别皱眉头，你确实如此。美是天才的一种形式——说真的，高于天才，因为它不需要任何解释。美是世间的一大存在，就像阳光、、或者是映在黑黑的水中，我们称之为的银色贝壳。它不容置疑，它拥有自己神圣的主权，它使占有美的人成为王子。你笑什么？唉，你失去以后就不会、笑了……有时，人会说美是肤浅的，也许如此。但至少不像思想那么肤浅。对我来说，美是奇迹中的奇迹。只有浅薄的人才不以貌取人。世界真正的神秘性在于可见之物，而不在于看不见的东西一乙一是啊，格雷先生，诸神厚爱你，可是诸神赐予你的，会很快被取走。你只有几年时间，能够实实在在，完完美美，充充实实地生活。青春一逝，美也随之而去。到那时，你会突然发现，没有留下胜利的凯歌，或者不得不满足于一些渺小的胜利，而往昔的记忆会使这些胜利比失败还要痛苦。月复一月，美渐渐衰朽，某种可怕的东西接踵而至。时间妒忌你，战争跟你的美貌作对。你脸色灰黄，两颊下陷，目光迟钝。你会感到无限痛苦……啊！你拥有青春的时候，就要感受它。不要虚掷你的黄金时代，不要去倾听枯燥乏味的东西，不要设法挽救无望的失败，不要把你的生命献给无知、平庸和低俗。这些都是我们时代病态的目标，虚假的理想。活着！把你宝贵的内在生命活出来。什么都别错过。不断寻找新的感受，什么都不要怕……一种新的享乐主义——那正是我们的世纪所缺乏的。你也许是它看得见的象征。有你这样的个性，你什么都干得成。世界只属于你一个季节……我遇见你的那一刻，我看得出，你并没有十分意识到自己是怎样一个人，实际上可以成为怎样一个人。你身上有那么多东西让我着迷，所以我觉得必须把某些关系到你的事告诉你。我想，要是你虚度了青春，那该有多不幸。因为你的青春岁月所剩无多——只有那么一点点时间了。普通的山花谢了又开，明年六月，金莲花会像现在这样开得金黄。再过一个月，铁线莲会长出似的紫色花朵，一年又一年，绿色的叶子支撑着紫色的。但我们的青春却一去不返。二十岁时，脉搏跳得很欢，现在却微弱无力了。我们的四肢废了，感官坏了。．我们衰变成了可怕的傀儡，只剩下记忆中令我们害怕的激情，以及我们没有胆量接受的巨大诱惑，依然拂之不去。青春啊，青春！除了青春，世上什么也没有！”

# Chapter 03

So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow…. And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow…. There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.6 No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that – perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims…. He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade!… And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryad-like and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analysed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence?7 But in our own century it was strange…. Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him – had already, indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of Love and Death.

这就是道连·格雷双亲的故事。讲述得十分粗略，却因为暗示着一段离奇而近乎现代的罗曼史，深深打动了他。一个漂亮的女人，为了疯狂的恋情而不顾一切。几周如痴如狂的甜蜜日子，被一桩奸诈丑恶的罪行所打断。挨过几个月无言的痛苦之后，一个婴儿在阵痛中出世了。死亡夺走了母亲，把孤苦伶仃的男孩留给了专横冷酷的老人。是啊，这是一个有趣的背景，烘托出了那男孩，使他更为完美。每一件赏心悦目的东西背后，总有一段悲哀的隐情。连最不起眼的小花要开放，世界也得经历阵痛。昨夜俱乐部的晚餐上，道连格雷多么富有魅力，坐在对面，沉浸在惊喜之中，目光愕然，双唇张开。红色的烛罩，把他那令人惊叹的面容映照得像一朵红红的玫瑰。跟他交谈，就好像拉一把精制的小提琴，琴弓的一推一拉，一抖一动，都会得到呼应……把影响施与别人真令人兴奋，确实无与伦比。把自己的灵魂投射进某种高雅的东西里，并让它在那里逗留一会儿；听到自己理性的见解产生了伴有激情和青春的音乐的回响；把自己的气质像一种微妙的流体或是奇异的香气那样，灌注进另一种气质；这些都给人一种真正的快乐，在我们这个如此局促、如此庸俗的时代，这个声色犬马、缺乏志向的时代，那也许是一种最舒心的快乐……他在巴兹尔画室巧遇的这个小伙子，还是一个了不起的典型，或者至少可以塑造成一个了不起的典型。他很高雅，具有古老的希腊大理石雕刻所保留的童稚般的纯真和美丽。你把他塑造成什么都行，可以做成巨神泰坦，也可以做成小玩具。多么可惜啊，这样的美竟注定要消失！……而巴兹尔呢？从心理学角度看，他真有意思！新的艺术技巧，观察生活的新的视角，出奇地因为某个人在场而得到了启发，而这个人自己却浑然不觉。沉默的精灵住在昏暗的林地里，毫无踪影地在空旷的走来走去，突然间像树神德律阿德斯那样显形了，而且一点也不害怕，因为画家的灵魂在寻觅着她。此刻，在他的灵魂中唤起了一种奇妙的情景，惟有在这种情景中，奇妙的东西才能够显现。于是，事物的形状和风格一定程度上变得高雅了，获得了某种象征意义，仿佛它们本身成了另一种更完美的东西的风格，使其从影子变成了实体。这一切真不可思议！他记起了历史上类似的情况。不是那位沉思型艺术家柏拉图首先这么分析的吗？波纳洛蒂不是把它刻在写有十四行组诗的彩色大理石上吗？但在我们这个世纪，这是不可理解的……是呀，就像道连·格雷不知不觉中影响着这位画家，使他创作出了出色的画像那样，他竭力要去影响道连·格雷。他要设法去控制他，事实上他已经成功了一半。他要得到那个奇妙的精灵。这个爱情和死亡的结晶，有着某种迷人的东西。

He played with the idea, and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy, and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and Philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of Pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante8 over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar9 sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate, seemed to give his wit keenness, and to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips, and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.

他把玩着这个想法，变得任性自恃起来，把它丢到空中，变换个样子，一会儿放走它，一会把它捉回来，用幻想使它闪光，用悖论使它飞翔。他这么玩着玩着，对愚蠢的赞颂竟幻化成了一种哲学，而哲学自己则变得年轻起来，如我们所能想象的那样，穿上酒迹斑斑的长袍，戴了常青藤花冠，踏着疯狂的欢快乐曲，像酒神的女祭司那样，在生命的小山上跳起舞来，嘲笑迟钝的赛利纳斯依然十分清醒。事实犹如受惊的森林，在她面前纷纷逃走了。她那白皙的脚，踩着巨大的酒榨机，机上坐着智者奥默，她踩呀踩呀，直到葡萄的汁水奥：波斯诗人和天文学家，著有诗歌《鲁拜集》，好以饮酒忘却死亡和对上帝的失望。泛起一阵阵紫色的泡沫，涌到她光着的脚周围，或者红色的酒泡溢出酒桶，滴在黑色倾斜的桶腰上。这是一件出色的即兴之作。他觉得道连·格雷目不转睛地看着他。由于意识到自己希望迷住听众中某个人的心，他的才思更加敏捷，他的想象更富有色彩。他才华横溢，浮想联翩，毫无顾忌。他使听者为之倾倒。他们跟着他的风笛笑个不停。道连·格雷始终盯着他，着了魔似地坐着，阵阵微笑掠过嘴唇，渐渐暗淡的眼神里出现了越来越惊讶的表情。

# Chapter 04

‘My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.’
“我的好家伙，没有一个女人是天才。女性是善于装饰的，她们从来没有话要说，却可以说得非常动人。女人代表物质对思想的胜利，正如男人代表思想对道德的胜利。”

My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect – simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up. B

“我的好家伙，一生中只爱一次的人是真正的浅薄者。他们自称为忠实和忠贞的，我管它叫习惯性的懒散，或是缺乏想像力。忠实之于情感生活，犹如一致性之于理智生活，纯粹是失败的自供状。什么忠实！将来我必须加以研究。里面包藏着一种贪财欲。要是不怕别人捡走，有很多东西我们准会扔掉"

Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. ‘Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!’

‘It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,’ said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. ‘But why should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?’

道连．格雷跳了起来，脸色通红，目光如火。“哈利，西比尔文是圣洁的！”

“只有圣洁的东西才值得去碰它，道连，”亨利勋爵说，话音里带着一丝莫名的悲哀。“可是你为什么要恼火呢？我想她迟早要属于你的。一个人恋爱的时候总是以自欺欺人开始，而以欺骗别人告终。这就是世人所说的罗曼史。无论怎么说，我想你是了解她的喽？”

As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science,14 but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life – that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect – to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord – there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.

He was conscious – and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes – that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent the lad was his own creation.He had made him premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.

Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.

Soul and body, body and soul – how mysterious they were! There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.

He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.

It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.

亨利勋爵离开房间的时候垂下了厚重的眼睑，陷入了沉思。显然很少有人像道连·格雷那样使他感兴趣。可是那小伙子对另外一个人发疯似的爱，并没有给他带来一丝因烦恼或嫉妒所生的痛苦。他感到高兴，因为道连成了更有意思的研究对象。他经常被自然科学的方法所吸引，却又觉得自然科学的一般论题太琐细，也太无意义。于是他先是解剖自己，末了又去解剖别人。他觉得人类的生活是一件值得探究的事。与此相比，其他东西都是没有价值的。事实是这样，当一个人看着生活奇怪地受着痛苦和愉快的煎熬的时候，他脸上无法佩戴玻璃假面具，也不可能阻止硫磺的烟雾熏得脑袋一片混沌，把想象搅成乱七八糟的幻想和梦呓。有些毒药难以捉摸，要了解它的性质，你自己也得中毒。有些疾病非常奇怪，要作出诊断，你必得亲身去体验。然而，你得到了何等巨大的报偿！世界对于你变得多么奇妙！要了解激情的铁一般的奇异逻辑，要知道理智的多情多彩的生活，要观察它们什么地方相遇，什么地方分离，哪一点上一致，哪一点上相左，是一种乐趣！又何必管它要付出多大的代价？为了得到一种新的感觉，再高的代价也是值得的。

他意识到，正是他的某些话，用音乐般的音调说出的音乐似的话，使道连·格雷的灵魂转向这位纯洁的姑娘，并为之倾倒。这么想，他玛瑙似的褐色眼睛里射出了喜悦的光芒。这小伙子很大程度上是他的创造物。他使他早熟，那很了不起。普通人等待着生活把秘密暴露给他们，而对少数人，对上帝的选民来说，生活的面纱还没有拉开，内中的秘密就尽收眼底了。有时，那是艺术所产生的效果，主要是文学艺术，因为它直接表现激情和理智。但有时一个复杂的人取而代之，担当起了艺术的职能，事实上，其自身便是一件艺术品。像诗歌、雕塑和绘画一样，生活本身就拥有精心创造的杰作。

不错，这小伙子有些早熟，就已开始了收获。他身上涌动着青春的脉搏和热情，但他的自我意识已经很强。对他进行观察是一种愉快。那么漂亮的脸蛋，那么美丽的灵魂，他使你为之惊叹。至于如何结局，或者注定要如何了结，都无关紧要。他就像露天表演或戏剧中的高雅角色，他们的欢乐似乎离你非常遥远，他们的忧愁却会激起你的美感，他们的伤痛像红红的玫瑰。

灵魂和肉体，肉体和灵魂，是多么神秘呀！灵魂中存在着性，肉体中有瞬时的灵性。感觉可以升华，理智可能堕落。谁能说得出何处是肉体冲动的终点，何处是灵魂冲动的起点？一般心理学家的武断定义是何等浅薄！然而要对不派的主张决定取舍又何其困难！难道灵魂是端坐在罪恶之屋中的幽灵？或者如乔达诺。布鲁诺所想，肉体真的是在灵魂里？把精神从物质中分离出来是一大秘密，精神和物质的统一也是一大秘密。

他开始考虑我们是否能使心理学彻底成为一门科学，向我们揭示生活的一切动力。我们似乎常常误解自己，也很少理解别人。经验不具有伦理价值。它只不过是人赐给错误的名字。道德学家总是把它视为一种警示，认为他对性格的培养具有一定的伦理效果，赞扬它教育我们应该遵循什么，启发我们应当避免什么。但是经验中没有动力。它像良心一样不是一种积极因素。它实际所昭示的，无非是我们的未来与我们的过去一模一样，我们一度犯过并十分厌恶的罪孽，我们又会愉快地一犯再犯。

他很清楚，实验法是对情欲作出科学分析的惟一方法。自然道连·格雷是他手头的一个专题，而且有可能得到丰富的成果。他对西比尔。文那种突如其来的痴心，是一个很有意思的心理现象。无疑这与好奇心有密切关系，对一种新体验的好奇和向往。然而它不是简单而是相当复杂的情欲。原本存在的孩提时代的感官本能，通过想象转化成为对这个青年来说远离感官的东西，也正因为这样就显得更加危险。关于情欲的来源，我们有些自欺欺人，但正是这种情欲有力地支配着我们。我们最弱的动机是那些我们意识到其本质的动机。事情常常是这样，当我们认为是在对别人进行试验的时候，实际上是在对自己进行着试验。

# Chapter 05

The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her eyes caught the melody, and echoed it in radiance: then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.

Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on Memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids were warm with his breath.

Then Wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.

这姑娘又大笑起来。嗓音里透出了笼中鸟般的喜悦。她的眼睛抓住了这美妙的旋律，产生了共鸣，闪烁出明亮的目光。随后闭了一会儿，仿佛要掩盖内心的秘密。再次张开的时候，眸子里飘过一阵梦幻似的雾翳。

薄唇利舌的智慧坐在旧椅子上同她说话，暗示她要谨慎，还引述了一本借用常识之名写成的《懦弱》一书。她置之不理。在激情的牢狱中她是自由的。她的王子，迷人王子，同她在一起。她召唤记忆来重塑王子的形象，派出灵魂去寻找他，并把他带了回来。他的亲吻再次在她嘴上燃烧，她的眼睑留着他呼吸的余温。

然后，智慧改变了手法，主张探秘和发现。这年轻人也许很有钱，要是这样，婚姻就应当考虑。世俗的狡狯，波浪似地撞击着她的耳壳，诡计的箭矢，从她身边滑过。她看到智慧的薄唇在抖动和微笑。

# Chapter 06

‘I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life. We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do. If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her. Why not? If he wedded Messalina2 he would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage. The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex. They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man’s existence.3 Besides, every experience is of value, and, whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his wife, passionately adore her for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else. He would be a wonderful study.’

“如今，无论什么事我都不说赞成，或者不赞成。以是或否的态度来对待生活是荒谬的，因为我们被送到世上不是来发表道德偏见的。我从不注意普通人说什么，也从不干预可爱的人干什么。要是一个人吸引我，他无论选择什么方式表达自己，对我来说都很可爱。道连·格雷爱上了一个扮演朱丽叶的漂亮姑娘，并打算和她结婚，那有什么不好？他就是娶了梅塞林娜也照样有吸引力。你知道我不是婚姻的卫士。婚姻的真正弊病在于使人无私。但无私的人是没有色彩的，缺乏个性。不过，婚姻使人的某些禀性更加复杂，保留了利己主义，并增加了不少其他自我意识。人们身不由己地过着多重生活，变得高度的条理化，而我认为高度条理化是人类生活的目的。此外，每一种经历都是有价值的。随你说婚姻如何不好，它毕竟是一种经历。我希望道连·格雷会娶这个姑娘为妻，死去活来地爱她半年，然后，又忽然迷上了另外一个人。他会成为一个很好的研究对象。”

“其实也没有什么好讲的，”他们在一张小圆桌旁就座后，道连叫道。“事情的经过无非就是这样：昨天晚上同你分手后，哈利，我穿上礼服，到了鲁伯特街，在你介绍的一家意大利小餐馆用了晚饭，随后八点钟上了剧院。西比尔扮演罗瑟琳。当然，布景很糟糕，奥兰多也荒唐可笑。可是那西比尔！你们真该见她！她女扮男装登场，好看极了，穿着一件带棕黄袖子的苔青色丝绒紧身衣，一条咖啡色的背带紧身裤，戴一顶精致的绿色小帽，帽上的一颗宝石系着羽毛。她还披了一个带兜帽衬着暗红色里子的大氅。在我眼里，她似乎从来没有这样美妙绝伦。她有着你画室里那尊塔纳格拉赤陶小雕像的全部风韵，巴兹尔。她的头发拥着她的脸，就像深色的叶子拥着浅色的玫瑰。至于她的演技嘛，嗯，今晚你们会看到的。她简直是个天生的艺术家。我坐在幽暗的包厢里，完全神魂颠倒了。我忘了自己身处伦敦，生活在十九世纪。我的爱把我带到了人所未见的森林。演出结束后，我到了幕后，同她攀谈起来。我们坐在一起，她的眼睛里突然出现了一个我从来没有见过的表情。我的嘴唇凑向了她的，两人便吻了起来。我无法向你们描述我当时的感觉。我的全部生活，似乎都浓缩成了尽善尽美的玫瑰色的欢愉。她浑身颤抖，像一朵摇曳着的白水仙，随后一下子跪倒在地，亲吻起我的手来。我觉得不该把这告诉你们，但实在忍不住。当然，我们订婚的事绝对保密，连她都没告诉。不知道我的监护人会怎么说，拉德利勋爵肯定会勃然大怒。但我不在乎，反正要不了一年就成年了，到那时爱怎么干都行。我从诗中取来了爱情，在莎士比亚剧中找到了妻子，巴兹尔，我做得很对是不是？被莎士比亚教会说话的嘴唇，耳语着把秘密告诉我。我搂抱着罗瑟琳，亲吻着朱丽叶。”

‘There is really not much to tell,’ cried Dorian, as they took their seats at the small round table. ‘What happened was simply this. After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street, you introduced me to, and went down at eight o’clock to the theatre. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course the scenery was dreadful, and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl! You should have seen her! When she came on in her boy’s clothes she was perfectly wonderful. She wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim brown cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk’s feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red. She had never seemed to me more exquisite. She had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose. As for her acting – well, you shall see her to-night. She is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled. I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen. After the performance was over I went behind, and spoke to her. As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her eyes a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can’t describe to you what I felt at that moment. It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She trembled all over, and shook like a white narcissus. Then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can’t help it. Of course our engagement is a dead secret. She has not even told her own mother. I don’t know what my guardians will say. Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don’t care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like. I have been right, Basil, haven’t I, to take my love out of poetry, and to find my wife in Shakespeare’s plays? Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.’

# Chapter 07

‘Don’t pay any attention to him, Dorian,’ said the painter. ‘I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl that has the effect you describe must be fine and noble. To spiritualize one’s age – that is something worth doing. If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world. This marriage is quite right. I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her you would have been incomplete.’

凡你喜欢的姑娘，必定是非常出众的，凡是具有你所描绘的那种效果的姑娘，必定是高雅的。使自己的时代脱俗，是一件值得做的事情。如果这姑娘能赋予一个没有灵魂的人以灵魂，能为过着肮脏丑陋的生活的人创造美感，能驱除他们的自私心，能把眼泪借给他们去为别人的不幸而哭泣，那就很值得你爱慕，也值得整个世界爱慕。这桩婚事很好，虽然起初我并不这样想，但现在我赞同了。神明为你创造了西比尔·文，没有她，你会是不完美的。”

‘Don’t talk like that about any one you love, Dorian. Love is a more wonderful thing than Art.’

‘They are both simply forms of imitation,’ remarked Lord Henry. ‘But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one’s morals to see bad acting. Besides, I don’t suppose you will want your wife to act. So what does it matter if she plays Juliet like a wooden doll? She is very lovely, and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting, she will be a delightful experience. Thereare only two kinds of people who are really fascinating – people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing. Good heavens, my dear boy, don’t look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming. Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She is beautiful. What more can you want?’

“别那样谈论你的心上人，道连。爱情比艺术更美妙。”

“两者都不过是模仿，”亨利勋爵议论道。“可我们还是走吧，道连，你不该再呆下去了。观看拙劣的演出无益于人的道德。此外，我想你也不会叫你的妻子去演戏，所以就是把朱丽叶演得像木偶一样又何妨？她很可爱，要是她对生活和艺术都一无所知，倒也不失为一种愉快的经历。只有两种人最具吸引力，一种是无所不知的人；另一种是一无所知的人。啊呀，我亲爱的小伙子，别那么悲伤了！保持年轻的秘密在于驱除不宜情绪。跟巴兹尔和我到俱乐部去吧，吸会儿烟，为西比尔·文的美貌干杯。她那么漂亮，你还需要什么呢？”

As the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to Covent Garden.4 The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street. The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain. He followed into the market, and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him some cherries. He thanked him, wondered why he refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly. They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. A long thin line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him, threading their way through the huge jade-green piles of vegetables. Under the portico, with its grey sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the Piazza. The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks. Iris-necked, and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds.

After a little while, he hailed a hansom, and drove home. For a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent Square with its blank close-shuttered windows, and its staring blinds. The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising. It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air.

拂晓时，他不知不觉已来到考文特露天市场附近。夜幕开启了，露出火红色的微光，苍穹像是一枚掏空了的珠子。满载着摇曳多姿的百合花的大车隆隆作响，慢悠悠地驶过空旷光洁的街道。空气里弥漫着浓郁的花香。对他来说，美丽的花儿似乎是一帖镇痛剂。他跟着那些人进了市场，看他们卸车。一个穿白色罩衫的赶车人送给他一些樱桃品尝，他道了谢，不明白为什么那人拒绝收钱，开始无精打采地吃起樱桃来。樱桃是半夜里采摘的，还带着月色的寒气。一长队男童，扛着一筐筐条子状的、黄玫瑰和红玫瑰，在他面前鱼贯而过，挨挨挤挤穿过一大堆绿宝石般的蔬菜。门廊下被太阳晒得褪了色的柱子旁边，闲荡着一群邋里邋遢不戴帽子的姑娘，等待着拍卖收场。其他的人都拥挤在广场咖啡屋的旋转门附近。拉车的高头大马打着滑，踩在粗糙的石子路上，摇动着马铃和马饰。有些车夫就睡在一堆麻袋中间。颈部色彩斑斓、脚呈粉红色的鸽子跳来跳去，啄着谷物。

过了一会儿，他叫了一辆马车回家。他在门口踯躅了一阵子。极目四顾，眺望寂静的广场，以及附近空空的紧闭的窗户和惹人眼目的百叶窗。此刻的天空一片乳色，屋顶在天空的反衬下闪闪发光。对面的一个烟囱升起了一缕轻烟，卷曲成紫色的丝带，飘向珠色的天空。

No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it. Suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.

Yet it was watching him, with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight. Its blue eyes met his own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him. It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses would die. For every sin that he committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him the visible emblem of conscience. He would resist temptation. He would not see Lord Henry any more – would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward’s garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things. He would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her amends, marry her, try to love her again. Yes, it was his duty to do so. She must have suffered more than he had. The fascination that she had exercised over him would return. They would be happy together. His life with her would be beautiful and pure.

He got up from his chair, and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he glanced at it. ‘How horrible!’ he murmured to himself, and he walked across to the window and opened it. When he stepped out on to the grass, he drew a deep breath. The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions. He thought only of Sibyl. A faint echo of his love came back to him. He repeated her name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her.

不，这不过是理智的混乱所造成的幻觉。他度过的那个可怕的夜晚留下了幻象。突然间，他脑子里闪过一个使人发疯的小红点。这幅画没有变，只有蠢人才以为它变了。

可是画像凝视着他，漂亮而扭曲的面孔带着狞笑，明亮的头发在朝阳下闪光。画像的蓝眼睛与他的相遇，他心头萌生了说不尽的遗憾，不是为他自己，而是为他自己的画像。它已经变了，还会变得更多。闪闪金光会褪成灰色，红白玫瑰似的容貌会憔悴。他每造一孽，脸上就会出现污点，毁掉白皙的肌肤。可是他决不造孽。这幅画无论变与不变，都是她良心的明白写照。他会拒绝诱惑。他再也不见亨利勋爵了——至少不再听他的话，那些难以捉摸的有毒理论。曾几何时在巴兹尔·霍尔华德的里，这些理论激起了他的痴心妄想。他要回到西比尔身边，跟她重归于好，同她结婚，努力再去爱她。是的，他有责任这样做。她一定比他更痛苦。可怜的孩子！他太自私了，对她很冷酷。西比尔又会重现曾经有过的魅力。他们在一起会很幸福，两人的生活会纯洁而美丽。

他从椅子上站起来，拉过一块很大的幕帘遮住画像，瞥了画像一眼，不觉打了个寒战。“多可怕！”他自言自语地低声说，走到窗前，打开了窗子。他到了草地上，深深地吸了一口气。清晨的新鲜空气驱走了一切阴暗的情绪。他只想着西比尔。身边响起了爱的回音，他反复叨念着西比尔的名字。露水浸湿了的花园里鸟儿在歌唱，似乎在向花儿诉说西比尔的故事。

# Chapter 08

Three o’clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life, and to weave them into a pattern; to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering. He did not know what to do, or what to think. Finally, he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved, imploring her forgiveness, and accusing himself of madness. He covered page after page with wild words of sorrow, and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach. When we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution. When Dorian had finished the letter, he felt that he had been forgiven.

钟敲了三点、四点和四点半，道连·格雷依然没有动弹。他竭力想收集生活的红色丝线，编织成一个图案；想找到一条通向乐观情绪的迷宫之路，因为他在那儿已经徘徊很久了。他不知道该怎么做，怎么想。最后，他走到桌旁，给他心爱的姑娘写了一封充满激情的信，请求宽恕并责备自己愚蠢。他写了一页又一页表示伤心的狂热的话，以及表示痛苦的更为狂热的话。他慷慨地自责。我们自责的时候总觉得别人无权责备我们。使我们得到赦免的是忏悔，而不是牧师。道连写完这封信以后便觉得自己得到了宽恕。

‘My dear Dorian,’ answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his case, and producing a gold-latten matchbox, ‘the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life. If you had married this girl you would have been wretched. Of course you would have treated her kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her. And when a woman finds that out about her husband, she either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman’s husband has to pay for. I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been abject, which, of course, I would not have allowed, but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.’

“亲爱的道连，”亨利勋爵回答，从烟盒里拿了一支香烟，同时取出一个镀金的火柴盒来。“女人改造男人的惟一方法是让他彻底感到厌倦，这样他会对生活了无兴趣。要是你跟这个姑娘结婚，那你就惨啦。当然你会待她好，人总会待那些自己毫不在乎的人很好。但她很快就会发觉你对她非常冷淡。而女人一旦发现丈夫的这一态度，要么变得邋遢成性，要么开始戴时髦的帽子，不过出钱的是别的女人的丈夫。我姑且不说社会地位不当的问题，那很可悲，当然我也是无法容忍的。但我可以明确告诉你，整桩婚姻会以彻底失败而告终。”

‘It is an interesting question,’ said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad’s unconscious egotism – ‘an extremely interesting question. I fancy that the true explanation is this. It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style. They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that. Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both. We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened? Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life. The people who have adored me – there have not been very many, but there have been some – have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me. They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman! What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details. Details are always vulgar.’

‘I must sow poppies in my garden,’ sighed Dorian.

‘There is no necessity,’ rejoined his companion. ‘Life has always poppies in her hands. Of course, now and then things linger. I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what killed it. I think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity. Well – would you believe it? – a week ago, at Lady Hampshire’s, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future. I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel.3 She dragged it out again, and assured me that I had spoiled her life. I am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she showed! The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen. They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it. If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce. They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you. Ordinary women always console themselves. Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours. Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons. It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands. They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one’s face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me; and I can quite understand it. Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all.4 Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life. Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.’

‘What is that, Harry?’ said the lad, listlessly.

‘Oh, the obvious consolation. Taking some one else’s admirer when one loses one’s own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets! There is something to me quite beautiful about her death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen. They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love.’

‘I was terribly cruel to her. You forget that.’

‘I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else. They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated. I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked. And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to everything.’

“这是一个很有趣的问题，”亨利勋爵说，津津乐道于玩弄小伙子无意识的自私心——“一个极其有趣的问题。我想真正的答案在这里：生活中真正的悲剧往往以非艺术的形式发生，以其赤裸裸的暴力、绝对的混乱、可笑的无意义和彻底的无定式，来伤害我们。悲剧会像粗俗不堪的行为一样对我们产生危害，给我们留下一个使用暴力的印象，我们因此而感到厌恶。然而，有时生活中出现的悲剧会拥有艺术美的成分。如果这些美的成分是真实的，那就会对我们产生具有戏剧性效果的吸引力。突然我们发现自己不再是演员，而是这个剧的观众了，或者两者兼而有之。我们观看自己的表演，这神奇的印象本身让我们着迷。眼下，实际是怎么回事呢？有人因为爱你而自杀了。要是我有这样的经历该多好，那会使我这辈子对爱富有真情。那些爱我的人——尽管不多，但还是有一些——总是一个劲儿地要活下去，虽然我对她们早已没有兴趣，或者她们早就感到我索然无味。她们变得肥胖而乏味，一碰上她们，这些人就立刻忆起旧来。女人的记忆多糟糕！又多可怕！完全暴露了智力的停滞！人应当吸收生活的色彩，而忘掉它的细节。细节永远是庸俗的。”

“那我得在花园里种上罂粟花，”道连叹息道。

“没有必要，”他的回答。“生活的手中始终掌握着罂粟花。当然，有时事情也很难忘却。曾经有一度，我整个季节只戴紫罗兰，以艺术的形式悼念一段不肯逝去的罗曼史。然而它最后终于消逝了。我忘了是什么使它烟消云散的。我想是她提出要为我而牺牲整个世界的那会儿。那往往是一个可怕的时刻，让人充满了对永恒的恐惧。是呀——你会相信吗？——一个星期之前，在汉普夏夫人那儿，我发觉自己就坐在提到的那个女人旁边。她执意要重温旧事，翻出陈年老账，并搜索未来。我已经把罗曼史埋葬在长春花花里。而她又将它拖了出来，说是我毁了她的生活。我得声明，晚宴上她吃得很多，所以我不必为她担。可是她那么不得体！往事的魅力在于其已成往事。而女人们从不知道什么时候帷幕已经降落，往往还想要第六幕。戏剧的矛盾已经全部解决，她们却要求继续演下去。要是随了女人们的心，一切喜剧都会出现悲剧性结尾，一切悲剧都会以闹剧的形式告终，虽有几分吸引力，却虚假做作，毫无艺术性可言。你要比我幸运。告诉你吧，道连，我所遇到的女人，没有一个会为我做出西比尔为你所做的一切。普通的女人常常会自我安慰，有些会求助于感情色彩来抚慰自己。穿紫红色衣服的女人，不管年龄大小，可千万不要相信。你也千万别相信过了三十五岁却仍然喜欢粉红色缎带的女人。这往往意味着她们有过一段历史。有的女人以突然发现丈夫的美德而得到极大的安慰。她们当着别人的面炫耀婚姻的美满，仿佛它是最诱人的罪孽。有些人则从宗教中得到安慰。一个女人曾告诉我，宗教的神秘有着跟调情一样的魅力，我对此能够充分理解。此外，没有比被人说成罪人更使人得意了。良心把我们大家都变成了利己主义者。是的，女人们在现代生活中所找到的安慰始终是无穷无尽的。说真的，我还没有提到最重要的安慰呢。”“什么安慰，哈利？”小伙子漫不经心地问道。

“哦，最明白不过的安慰。那就是一旦失去了自己的意中人，便把别人的拿过来。在上流社会，那常常会美化一个女人。但是，道连，西比尔．文同常见的女人真是天差地别！我觉得她的死有一种美。我很高兴，在我生活的时代能够出现这样的奇迹。它使人相信我们所玩弄的一切是真实的，比如罗曼史、激情和爱情。”

“我对她极为冷酷，你忘啦。”

恐怕女人欣赏冷酷，欣赏极度冷酷，胜过一切。她们有一种了不起的原始本能。我们解放了她们，而她们依然做着奴仆，照样寻找着主人，喜欢受人支配。可你非常出色。我从来没有见你真的生过那么大气，但我能想象你显得多可爱。前天，你对我说了一番话，当时听来似乎是奇谈怪论，现在我明白，那绝对真实，而且是解开一切秘密的钥匙。”

Poor Sibyl! what a romance it had all been! She had often mimicked death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her, and taken her with him. How had she played that dreadful last scene? Had she cursed him, as she died? No; she had died for love of him, and love would always be a sacrament to him now. She had atoned for everything, by the sacrifice she had made of her life. He would not think any more of what she had made him go through, on that horrible night at the theatre. When he thought of her, it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world’s stage to show the supreme reality of Love. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace. He brushed them away hastily, and looked again at the picture.6

He felt that the time had really come for making his choice. Or had his choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him – life, and his own infinite curiosity about life. Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins – he was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame: that was all.

A feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas. Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him. Morning after morning, he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him at times. Was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded? Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair? The pity of it! the pity of it!

For a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease. It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. And, yet, who, that knew anything about Life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught? Besides, was it really under his control? Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all? If thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things? Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity? But the reason was of no importance. He would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to alter. That was all. Why inquire too closely into it?

For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He would be able to follow his mind into its secret places. This portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him his own body, so it would reveal to him his own soul. And when winter came upon it, he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he would keep the glamour of boyhood. Not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade. Not one pulse of his life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he would be strong, and fleet, and joyous. What did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas? He would be safe. That was everything.

可怜的西比尔！这一切多浪漫呀！她常常在舞台上模仿死亡。然后死亡触摸她，把她带走了。她是怎样扮演那可怖的最后一幕的呢？她死去的时候诅咒过他吗？不会的，她为爱他而死去。对他来说，今后爱情永远是圣洁的。她以牺牲自己的生命偿还了一切。他不会再去想那个可怕的晚上她让他经历的事情。他想起她来时，会把她视为一个悲剧人物，被送到世界舞台上来显示爱的至高无上的存在。一个奇妙的悲剧人物？他一想起她孩子似的外貌，奇特迷人的举止，腼腆羞怯的风度，眼泪便夺眶而出。他匆匆挥去泪水，再看了一眼画像。

他觉得自己作出选择的时刻真的到来了。要不，他已经作出了选择？是的，生活以及他对生活的无限好奇，为他作出了选择。常驻的青春、巨大的热情、微妙而神秘的享受、狂热的欢乐以及更狂热的堕落，是他将要享有的一切。画像将为他承担耻辱的包袱，就是那么回事。

他一想起等待着画布上那张英俊的脸的是玷污，一阵痛楚悄悄袭上心头。有一回，他孩子气地模仿那喀索斯，曾经亲吻了，或是假装亲吻了画像上此刻对他冷笑的嘴唇。一个早上，又一个早上，他坐在画像跟前，像他有时感觉到的那样，惊叹它的俊美，几乎为之倾倒。难道画像随着他自己屈服于每一次诱惑而变化？难道它会变成狰狞可怖、令人厌恶的东西，只配藏进上锁的房间，远离曾经那么多次把它神奇的飘发染成金色的阳光？可惜啊，可惜！

一瞬间他想要祈祷，希望自己与画像之间的通感会消失。以前，应他的祷告，画像起了变化。也许应他的另一次祷告，画像会维持原貌不变。然而，凡是懂得一点生活的人，谁会愿意放弃永葆青春的机会呢，且不管这机会如何荒诞不经，或者可能隐伏许多致命的后果？此外，难道这画像真的控制在他手中了吗？是不是祈祷真的产生了所期望的效果？可不可能有什么科学的原因来解释这一切呢？如果一种想法能对一个活体产生影响，它可不可能对死的无机体产生影响呢？不，在没有想法或者欲望的情况下，我们身外的东西会不会同我们的心境和情感产生共鸣，并由于暗中的爱和奇怪的相似，原子和原子之间相互吸引呢？可是原因是无关紧要的，反正他再也不会通过祈祷招徕可怕的力量了。大不了画像要变就变吧，何必那么去细究呢？

观看画像确实是一种乐趣。他会跟踪自己的思想，直至其隐秘处。画像会成为他最神奇的镜子。正如画像已经展示了他的身体一样，它也会向他展示他的灵魂。当光临画像的时候，他本人仍会站立于在的边缘颤抖的地方。当血色从画像的脸上悄然褪去，留下白垩画成的苍白假面和木然的眼睛时，他自己会保持少年的魅力。他迷人的青春永远不会褪色，他生命的搏动永远不会削弱。他会像希腊的众神那样强健、敏捷、欢快。画布上的彩色形象发生变化有什么关系呢？他自己会平安无事，那是最要紧的。

# chapter 09

‘No,’ said Dorian Gray, ‘there is nothing fearful about it. It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives. They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean – middle-class virtue, and all that kind of thing. How different Sibyl was! She lived her finest tragedy. She was always a heroine. The last night she played – the night you saw her – she acted badly because she had known the reality of love. When she knew its unreality, she died, as Juliet might have died. She passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her. Her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered. If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment – about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six – you would have found me in tears. Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely. Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me. That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered – I forget exactly what it was. Finally he succeeded, and nothing could exceed his disappointment. He had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui, and became a confirmed misanthrope. And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view. Was it not Gautier1 who used to write about la consolation des arts? I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow2 together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle. Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp, there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me. To become the spectator of one’s own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this. You have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now. I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend. Of course I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he is. You are not stronger – you are too much afraid of life – but you are better. And how happy we used to be together! Don’t leave me, Basil, and don’t quarrel with me. I am what I am. There is nothing more to be said.’

“不，”道连·格雷说，“这件事没有什么可的。这是我们时代最伟大的浪漫的悲剧之一。演戏的人总是过着最普通的生活。他们是好丈夫，或是忠贞的妻子，或是非常乏味的人。你知道我的意思——中产阶级的德性和一整套诸如此类的东西。西比尔多么与众不同！她上演了自己最出色的悲剧。她永远是位悲剧女主角。她出演的最后一个晚上——你看到的那个晚上——演得很糟，因为她懂得了爱的存在。她知道爱不存在的时候，便死去了，就像朱丽叶会如此死去一样。于是她再次化人艺术之境。在她身上有一种殉道者的精神，她的死具有一切殉道那种悲哀的徒劳，一种荒废的美。但是我在说这话的时候，你千万不要以为我不感到痛苦。要是昨天你在那一时刻来——五点半，或是五点三刻——你会看到我在流？目。连当时在场的哈利，虽然是他带来的消息，也弄不清我当时有多难过。我痛苦万分。后来我的痛苦过去了。我无法重复一种情绪，除了感伤主义者，谁都做不到。而你，巴兹尔，很不讲道理。你来安慰我，这很令人感动。你发觉我已经得到了安慰，于是便勃然大怒。这怎么像一个富有同情心的人呢！你使我想起哈利讲的一个故事。有一个慈善家，一生中花了二十年的时间，来解除某种疾苦，或是改变某项不公平的法律，记不准是什么了。最后他终于大功告成，但同时也失望极了。他无所事事，差一点因为厌倦而死，成了一个十足的厌世主义者。此外，亲爱的巴兹尔，要是你真的是来安慰我，那就教会我忘掉已经发生的事儿，或者教我从适当的艺术角度来看待这个问题。戈蒂叶不是一再写到用艺术来安慰吗？我记得一天在你的画室里捡起一本牛皮封面的小书，偶尔看到了那句令人欣慰的话。可是，我不像我们一起在罗马时你告诉我的那个年轻人。那人常说黄缎子可以安慰生活中的任何痛苦。我却喜欢摸得着拿得起的美的东西。古老的锦缎、绿色的青铜、漆器工艺品、象牙雕刻、精美的环境、奢华的陈设，你都可以从中得到启发。但是，这些东西所创造的，或者至少是昭示的艺术气息，对我来说更为重要。正如哈利所说，做自己生活的旁观者是逃避生活的痛苦。我这么同你说话，你会觉得奇怪。你没有认识到我已经长大了。你我相识时我还是个小学生，现在我是大人了。我有新的情感、新的思想、新的见解。我跟以前不同了，但你得跟以前一样爱我。我变了，但你得永远是我的。当然我很喜欢哈利。可我知道你比他好。你并不比他强——你太害怕生活——但你更好。我们过去在一起的时候多么愉快！别离开我，巴兹尔，也不要同我争吵。我还是我。除此之外，没有别的好说了。”

‘I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you,5 your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. When you were away from me you were still present in my art…. Of course I never let you know anything about this. It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it myself. I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes – too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them…. Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you. Then came a new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman’s cloak and polished boar-spear. Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian’s barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. You had leant over the still pool of some Greek woodland, and seen in the water’s silent silver the marvel of your own face.6 And it had all been what art should be, unconscious, ideal, and remote. One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time. Whether it was the Realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell. But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.7 I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it. Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me. Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right…. Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint. Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates. Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour – that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him. And so when I got this offer from Paris I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition. It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown. You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.’

“我看出来你注意到了。别开口。等你听了我的话以后再说。道连，从我遇到你的那一刻起，你的人格对我产生了非同寻常的影响。我的灵魂，我的头脑，我的精力都被你所左右。你成了我看不见的理想的可见的化身，那种理想像一个美妙的梦，在我们艺术家的记忆中拂之不去。我崇拜你。于是你同谁说话，我就妒忌谁。我要一个人占有你。同你在一起我就感到愉快。你离开我的时候你依然出现在我的艺术里……当然，这件事，我从来没有告诉过你。我不可能这样做，因为你不会理解。我自己也难以理解。我只知道我面对着完美，世界在我的眼睛里已经变得妙不可言——也许是太美妙了，因为这种疯狂的崇拜存在着失去崇拜对象的危险，它并不亚于保持崇拜对象的危险……日子一周一周地过去，我越来越被你所吸引。然后开始了新的变化。我把你画成身穿精致盔甲的帕里斯，画成身披猎人的斗篷，手持雪亮的狩猎梭镖的美少年阿多尼斯。你还头戴沉重的莲花花冠，坐在阿德里安国王的船头，扫视着绿色混浊的尼罗河。你俯视希腊森林一泓平静的池水，在悄然的银白色水中，看到了自己动人的容貌。这些画面都是无意识的、理想的、遥远的，符合艺术的本质。有一天，有时候我想是致命的一天，我决定替你画一幅奇妙的画像，按你的实际情况来画，不穿古代的服装，而是你自己的衣服，生活在你自己的时代。我说不清楚，是现实主义的方法，还是仅仅你人格的魅力，无遮无盖地呈现在我面前。但我明白，作画时每一笔、每一层颜色似乎都流露着我的秘密。我开始担心别人会知道我的崇拜。我觉得，道连，我流露的东西太多了，我在画像里倾注了自己太多的东西。于是我决定绝不允许把画拿去展出。你有点生气。但那时你不明白这一切对我意味着什么。我同哈利谈起过这件事，他笑话我。可我毫不在乎。画像完成以后，我独自坐在画像旁边，觉得自己是对的……哎，几天以后，画像离开了画室。我一摆脱画像的存在所产生的巨大的吸引力，我便似乎觉得自己很傻，竟会想希腊神话中的特洛伊王子，因为把斯巴达王墨涅拉俄斯美丽的妻子海伦引诱走而引起特洛伊战争。象我除了看到你很漂亮以及我可以画之外还看到了别的东西。甚至现在，我不禁感到，那种认为创作中所感受到的激情在完成的作品中会真的有所体现的想法，是错误的。艺术往往比我们想象的要抽象。形状和颜色只告诉我们形状和颜色——如此而已。我常常觉得，艺术更多的是掩盖而不是暴露艺术家。所以我得到巴黎的邀请以后便决定把你的画像作为主要展品。我根本没有想到你会拒绝。现在我明白你是对的，画像不能展出。你千万别为我告诉你的事生我的气，道连。就像我一次对哈利说的那样，你生来就是让人崇拜的。”

# Chapter 11

For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him, seemed never to leave him. Even those who had heard the most evil things against him, and from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs, could not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him. He had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room. There was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them. His mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished. They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.

Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends, or thought that they were so, he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him, looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass. The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure. He grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul. He would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age. He would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile. He mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs.

There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his own delicately-scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the Docks, which, under an assumed name, and in disguise, it was his habit to frequent, he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul, with a pity that was all the more poignant, because it was purely selfish. But moments such as these were rare. That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him, as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification. The more he knew, the more he desired to know. He had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them.

Yet he was not really reckless, at any rate in his relations to society. Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art. His little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him, were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver. Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world. To them he seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to ‘make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty’.1 Like Gautier, he was one for whom ‘the visible world existed’.

And, certainly, to him Life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation. Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and Dandyism,2 which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him. His mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him in everything that he did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful, though to him only half-serious, fopperies.

For, while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the London of his own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the ‘Satyricon’3 once had been, yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum, to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane. He sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.

The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence. But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic. As he looked back upon man moving through History, he was haunted by a feeling of loss. So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose! There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear, and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape, Nature, in her wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions.

Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life, and to save it from that harsh, uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival. It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly; yet, it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience. Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be. Of the ascetism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing. But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.

There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie. Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room, and crouch there. Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills, and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers, and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave. Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern. The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known. We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness, and the memories of pleasure their pain.

It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.

他得天独厚的美，曾那么打动过巴兹尔·霍尔华德和其他人，似乎永远不会从他身上消失。即便有人风闻了他的恶行，即便有关他生活方式的奇闻悄悄在伦敦传播，并成为俱乐部中的谈资，但人们同他见面时都不会相信那些有损他名誉的谣传。他始终保持着一种不受世俗玷污的神态。言谈粗鲁的人一见他进了房间，便立即闭嘴。他纯朴的脸上总有一种申斥的表情。只要他在场，他们就会回忆起自己失去的天真，并无不感到惊奇，这人如此迷人，如此高雅，却能不受这个肮脏而又声色犬马的时代的污染。

他常常会神秘地失踪很长一段时间，从而引起他的或是自认为是他的人的奇怪猜测。每次回得家来，他总要先溜到楼上锁着的房间，用那把从不离身的钥匙打开门，手拿镜子，站在巴兹尔。霍尔华德为他所作的画像前，时而看看画布上那张丑恶变老的脸，时而瞧瞧在雪亮的镜子中相视而笑的白皙年轻的面容。明显的对比使他兴奋不已。他越来越迷恋于自己英俊的容貌，越来越对自己灵魂的腐败感兴趣。他会细致地，有时是带着恶狠狠的愉悦，来观察讨厌的线条镌刻在起了皱纹的额头上，或是悄悄地爬上很有肉感的嘴巴。有时会觉得纳闷，在罪孽的迹象和衰老的迹象之间，究竟哪一个更可怕呢。他会把自己白皙的手放在画像粗糙发胖的手上，嘲笑那变形的躯体和衰朽的四肢。

当他躺在幽香满室的卧房难以成眠的时候，当他改姓换名、乔装打扮走访码头附近名声不好的酒店，躺在污秽的房间里无法入睡的时候，他偶尔会想起给自己的灵魂带来的毁灭，不免生出一种完全是自私的，因而也更为强烈的惋惜之情。但这样的时候不多。亨利勋爵和他一起坐在朋友的里时，在他心中激起的对生活的好奇心，已与日俱增，很令他满意。他知道得越多就越想知道，产生了一种越喂越饿的极度饥饿感。

但是他并没有真的无所顾忌，至少在跟上流社会的关系上是这样。，每个月一两次，在社交季节则每个星期三晚上，他会让自己漂亮的住宅向外界敞开，邀请最有名的音乐家，以他们奇妙的艺术取悦宾客。他那些规模不大的宴请，在安排上总是得到亨利勋爵的帮助。这类宴请以对被邀请人的悉心挑选和安排而闻名。同样出名的是，餐桌的装饰格调十分高雅，异国花朵、绣花桌布、金银古盘，都摆得微妙而和谐。说真的，尤其是很多年轻人，看到了或是想象自己已经看到，道连真正实现了他们在伊顿公学或牛津大学时的梦想，成了把学者货真价实的文化素养同交际场中人的风度、盛名和完美的举止相统一的典范。在他们的心目中，道连似乎是与被但丁描绘成“以崇拜美来完善自己”的人志同道合的。像戈蒂叶一样，道连是一个“客观世界为他而存在”的人。

当然，对他来说，生活是首要的、最伟大的艺术，其他艺术似乎是为它所作的准备。他当然也迷恋于时尚和派头，时尚使真正奇妙的东西风行一时，派头以其独有的方式强调美的绝对现代性。他衣装的式样和时不时摆出的派头，对梅费厄舞厅的花花公子和帕尔莫尔俱乐部的橱窗，都产生了明显的影响。这些人模仿他的一举一动，连他出于好玩，偶尔才露出的纨绔子弟的翩翩风度，也一个劲儿要学。他很乐意接受几乎一到成年便被授予的地位。想到自己之于当代的伦敦很可能就是《萨蒂里孔》的作者之于当年尼禄时代的罗马，便有一种说不出的愉快。但内心深处却不甘于作“时尚的主宰”，让人请教一下戴什么宝石，怎样戴领带，如何用手杖而已。他要建立某种新的生活纲领，内含理性的哲学，有条有理的原则，并使感官脱俗来实现其最高目标。

崇拜感官常常不无理由地要受到贬损。人生来就害怕比自身要强大的欲望和感受，也意识到自己与不那么高度组织化的生存体有着共同的欲望和感受。但道连·格雷似乎觉得，感官的本质始终没有被认识，感官之所以停留在原始的性阶段，是因为世人用饥饿疗法迫使其就范，或者用痛苦来扼杀它，而不是努力使其成为新精神的一部分，而求美的良好本能将是这种新精神的主要特点。回顾人类的整个历史，道连被一种损失感所困扰。我们放弃了那么多东西！而不过是为了达到如此微不足道的目的！疯也似的任性抵制，形形色色的自我折磨和自我克制，其根本原因在于害怕，其结果是彻底的堕落，比人们出于无知，努力要摆脱的想象中的堕落要可怕得多。造物主逐出了修道人，让他以荒漠中的野兽果腹，却又赐予隐士以兽类为伴，那实在是一种绝妙的讽刺。

是的，正如亨利勋爵所预言的那样，一种新享乐主义将会出现，以重新创造生活，把生活从严酷而不合时宜的清教徒主义中解救出来。在我们这个时代，清教徒主义正不可思议地复活着。当然，这种享乐主义也求助于理智，但并不接受任何含有牺牲情感体验的理论或体系。事实上其目的在于使生活本身就成为体验，而不是体验的结果，且不管这种结果是苦还是甜。禁欲主义使感觉麻木，庸俗的挥霍放荡使感觉迟钝，新享乐主义与它们无关。不过，它教人珍惜生命的瞬间，因为生命本身就是转瞬即逝的。

不少人有时候天没亮就醒来，多半是在那些我们倾心于死的无梦之夜，或是经历了恐惧和奇奇怪怪的欢乐的夜晚之后，那时闪过我们脑际的是比现实更可怕的幻象，它具有一切怪诞事物所隐藏的活力，这种幻象赋予哥特式艺术以持久的生命力。人们可以想见，哥特式艺术特别属于头脑患有幻想症的艺术家。白色的手指慢慢地伸进窗帘，似乎还在抖动。无声的影子，奇形怪状，黑乎乎一片，钻进了房间的角落，并在那儿栖息。室外，鸟儿拨弄着树叶，或是上班者人声鼎沸，或是风呜咽着从山上下来，在寂静的房子周围盘桓，仿佛担心惊扰了沉睡者，但又必须把睡眠从紫色的山洞中唤醒。一层层昏暗的薄纱被掀开，万物渐渐地恢复了原状和本色。我们观察着黎明以其自古以来就有的方式重建世界。暗淡的镜子又开始照见东西。没有火焰的小蜡烛依旧竖立在老地方，旁边放着一本我们看了一半的书，或是我们在舞会上戴过扎着铅丝的小花，或是一封我们不敢读或者读了无数次的信。似乎什么都没有改变。我们所熟知的现实生活从虚幻的夜影中跳出来了，我们得在原来停止的地方继续我们的生活。我们悄悄地涌起了一种可的感觉，不得不让精力按陈规陋习枯燥地循环往复；或者我们产生了一种不着边际的愿望，希望有一天早晨睁开眼睛，发现令我们高兴的是，在黑暗中世界已经重建。在新世界中，万物都有新的形状和颜色，而且都会发生变化，或者都有自己的秘密。在新世界中，往事会变得无足轻重，或者没有立足之地，或者至少不会让人出于义务和悔恨而耿耿于怀，相反，即使是欢乐的记忆也带有苦味，愉快的回想也是痛苦的。

道连·格雷觉得，正是创造这样的世界构成了他真正的生活目的，或者真正的生活目的之一。他要寻找一种新奇而愉快的感觉，一种具有罗曼史所必不可少的陌生成分的感觉。在寻找中他会采用自知见异于自己天性的思想方法，沉湎于其微妙的影响。然后他会抓住这些影响的色彩，满足理智上的好奇心，随后又会冷漠地将这些影响弃之一旁。这种冷漠与道地的火热性格是相容的，而且根据现代心理学家的说法，其实是火热性格的先决条件。

It was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the Roman Catholic communion; and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him. The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize. He loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement, and watch the priest, in his stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid water that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the ‘panis cælestis’, the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice, and smiting his breast for his sins. The fuming censers, that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers, had their subtle fascination for him. As he passed out, he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals, and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.

But he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail. Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him for a season; and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased. Yet, as has been said of him before, no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself. He felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.

据一度谣传，道连想要加入罗马基督教教派。确实罗马教的仪式一向对他有很大的吸引力。每天的牺牲虽然比古老世界的一切牺牲真的要可怕得多，却打动了他。他被打动的，是对感官的巧妙抵制，是罗马教成分中原始的单纯，是罗马教所象征的人类悲剧永恒的悲哀。他喜欢跪在冰冷的大理石人行道上，观看身穿绣花法衣的牧师用白皙的手慢慢地揭开圣体盘的罩布，或者举起装有白色圣饼嵌满宝石的灯笼形圣体匣，我们有时设想这种圣饼是天使的面包。或者观看牧师们穿着耶稣受难时的衣装，把圣饼弄碎放进圣餐杯，并以捶胸来悔罪。身穿镶花边的大红衣服、神情严肃的孩子们，把蒸腾的香炉像镀金的硕大花朵那样抛到空中，这情景对他有一种难以言说的吸引力。他走出教堂的时候，总要惊奇地看一眼那些着黑衣服的忏悔者，希望自己也坐在暗影里，倾听善男信女们隔着陈的栅栏诉说自己生活中的故事。

但是他决不会一本正经地接受某个信条和体系，而犯下遏制智力发展的错误，或者误把只适宜于没有和的夜晚逗留一夜或者几个小时的客栈，当成了栖身的住所。神秘主义有一种化普通为新奇的威力，并往往伴有微妙的彻底解脱主义，曾一度打动了道连。但在另一个时期，道连却又倾向于德国达尔文主义运动的唯物主义思想，津津乐道于把人的思想和激情追溯到大脑中珍珠似的细胞，或是人体中某根白色的神经。他还赞赏这样的观点，即精神绝对依赖于物质，不论该物质是病态的还是健康的，正常的还是反常的。然而，正如前面说到的那样，他觉得比之于生活，没有一种理论是重要的。他强烈地感到，一切理性的思考一旦脱离行动和实验是多么苍白。他明白，感觉同灵魂一样有自己的精神秘密需要袒露。

And so he would now study perfumes,7 and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily-scented oils, and burning odorous gums from the East. He saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one’s passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots, and scented pollen-laden flowers, of aromatic balms, and of dark and fragrant woods, of spikenard that sickens, of hovenia that makes men mad, and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.

于是他现在又研究起香水和其制造的秘密来了，蒸馏各类香气很浓的油，燃烧来自东方、气味难闻的树脂。他知道人的情绪都在感官中得到反映，所以便潜心于发现两者之间的真实关系，探究乳香中有什么东西使人变得神秘；龙涎香为什么能撩拨人的热情；紫罗兰能唤起对了结的罗曼史的记忆；麝香会扰乱头脑；金香木要玷污想象。他总想确立真正的香水心理学，估算着各类物质的不同效果，例如有甜香味的根子、带有花粉的香花、芳香的香膏、黑色的香树、闻之使人作呕的甘松香油、会弄得人发疯的乔木，还有据说能驱除心里郁闷的芦荟。

Of such insolences and attempted slights he, of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner, his charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him, were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him. It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared, after a time, to shun him. Women who had wildly adored him, and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.

Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many, his strange and dangerous charm. His great wealth was a certain element of security. Society, civilized society at least, is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating. It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef. And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his private life. Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold entrées, as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject; and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view. For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it. It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us. Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.

Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray’s opinion. He used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the Ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence. To him, man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead. He loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins.

对这样的傲慢和轻蔑，他自然不以为意。大多数人认为，他率直有礼的举止、孩子般的迷人的微笑、似乎永不消失的青春的无穷魅力，其本身足以回答流传的诽谤，他们就是这么称其为诽谤的。可是显然，有些与他来往密切的人，后来似乎也躲避他了。那些狂热地爱慕他，为了他而不顾旁人的非难和无视社会习俗的女人，一见道连·格雷走进房间，便因为耻辱或害怕而顿然失色。

但是，在很多人眼里，这些嘁嘁喳喳的流言只会增加他奇怪而危险的魅力。他的巨额财富为他提供了相当的保障。社会，至少文明社会，不会轻易相信诋毁既有钱而又具吸引力的人的传言。世人有_种直觉：风度比道德更为重要，还认为至高无上的体面还不如拥有一个好厨师值钱。倘使有人以蹩脚的饭菜或劣酒宴客，纵然人家告诉你此人的私生活无可指责，那也是一个很可怜的安慰。就像有一次他与亨利勋爵谈起这个问题时勋爵所说的那样，连基本的德性都抵不上一道不冷不热的主菜。也许关于他的观点，还有很多话可说。上流社会的准则和艺术的准则是一致的，或者应当是一致的。对上流社会来说，形式极为重要，既要有礼仪的庄重又要有其虚假性，要把传奇剧的虚假成分同剧中悦人的机智和美结合起来。难道虚假很可怕吗？我认为并不可怕，不过是丰富我们个性的一种手段而已。这些至少是道连的观点。他过去总是对某些人的肤浅的心理学感到纳闷。他们认为人的自我是简单的、永久的、可靠的，属于单一的本质。对他来说，人具有多重生活和多重感觉，是一个多重体的复杂，内中有传承下来的思想和激情的奇怪遗产。人的肉体本身就染上了逝者可怕的疾病。他喜欢漫步在自己乡问别墅荒凉的画廊里，欣赏那些他们的血在自己血管中流动的人的画像。

# Chapter 16

A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors. From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards brawled and screamed.

Lying back in the hansom, with his hat pulled over his forehead, Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him on the first day they had met, ‘To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.’ Yes, that was the secret. He had often tried it, and would try it again now. There were opium-dens, where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.

The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull. From time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy. Once the man lost his way, and had to drive back half a mile.1 A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles. The side-windows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist.

天空开始下起了冷雨。在滴答的浓雾中，街灯看上去犹如憧憧鬼影。酒店正在打烊，一群男女聚在门外，零零落落，人影模糊。有些酒吧里传出了刺耳的笑声；另一些酒吧里，酒鬼们吵吵嚷嚷，大声尖叫。

道连．格雷仰靠在马车上，帽子低低地压着前额，双目无神地注视着这个大城市的耻辱，不时自言自语重复着亨利勋爵第一天同他见面时说的话，”用感官治疗灵魂，用灵魂治疗感官。不错，这就是秘密。他试过多次，现在又要试了。鸦片窝可以让你买得遗忘，恐怖窝可以用疯狂的新罪，摧毁旧恶的记忆。

像一个黄黄的头骨，低低地悬挂在天空。一块奇形怪状的云，不时伸出长长的胳膊，把遮住。越是往前，汽灯就越少，街道也越来越窄，越来越暗。有一回车夫还迷了路，不得不折回半英里。马踩着水潭，溅起泥浆，身上直冒热气。马车两边的窗子上，蒙上了法兰绒般的雾气。

The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider. The monotony became unbearable, and, as the mist thickened, he felt afraid.

路似乎没有尽头。街道像是一只爬动的蜘蛛编织的黑色蛛网。那种单调令人难以忍受。雾越来越浓，他有些害了。

It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still have dominated his temper. From cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all man’s appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre. Ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real, became dear to him now for that very reason. Ugliness was the one reality. The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of Art, the dreamy shadows of Song. They were what he needed for forgetfulness. In three days he would be free.

据说激烈的情绪会使人的思路兜圈子。确实，道连·格雷咬着的嘴唇讨厌地重复着有关灵魂和感官的微妙字眼，直到自己的情绪在这些字眼中得到了充分的表达。而且在理智的应允下，他为这种激烈的情绪找到了正当理由。不然，他的脾气会仍然受情绪所支配。在他的脑细胞里潜伏着一个想法；生的强烈欲望——人类的欲望中最可怕的一个，使他每一根颤抖的神经纤维都活跃起来。丑恶曾一度令他讨厌，因为丑恶给人一种真实感。而现在却因其真实，反觉得可爱了。丑恶是惟一的真实。粗暴的争吵、可恶的鸦片窝、混乱的生活中赤裸裸的暴力、小偷和流浪汉的肮脏生活，就其给人的强烈真实的印象而言，要比一切优美的艺术形象和梦幻般的歌生动得多。这些正是他为了忘却所需要的。三天以后他就会无忧无虑了。

Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. His meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him, and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door, as Basil Hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult. He bit his lip, and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad. Yet, after all, what did it matter to him? One’s days were too brief to take the burden of another’s errors on one’s shoulders. Each man lived his own life, and paid his own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault. One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her dealings with man Destiny never closed her accounts.

There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature, that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will. They move to their terrible end as automatons move. Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination, and disobedience its charm. For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience. When that high spirit, that morning-star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he fell.

在蒙蒙细雨中，道连·格雷急急地沿着码头走去。与艾德里安·辛格尔顿的相遇奇怪地打动了他，心里觉得纳闷，那个年轻人的毁灭，是不是像巴兹尔·霍尔华德当面出丑说他的那样，真的与他有关。他咬着嘴唇，一瞬间双眼透出了哀伤。然而，说到底这与他何干？人的生命那么短暂，又何必把他人的过错揽到自己身上。各人都过着自己的生活，也为此付出自己的代价。说实在，还得一而再，再而三地偿付。命运在与人交易时永远不会结账。

心理学家告诉我们，有时候，当犯罪或是世人称之为犯罪的那种情绪，支配着天性时，人体的每一根纤维就像头脑的每一个细胞那样，似乎都本能地产生了一种可怕的冲动。在这样的时刻，无论男女，都丧失了意志的自由，不由自主地奔向可怕的结局。

选择已被剥夺，良心或是泯灭，或是依旧存在，但存在着给予叛逆以诱惑，赋予反抗以魅力。就像神学家孜孜不倦地提醒我们的那样，一切罪孽都来自于反抗。那个高尚的神灵，也就是那颗罪恶的晨星，是以叛逆者的身份从天上降落到人间的。


# Chapter 17

Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved. Difference of object does not alter singleness of passion. It merely intensifies it. We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.

浪漫的爱情通过重复而生存下去，而重复又把欲望变成了艺术。此外，每次爱的滋味都是独特的。对象的不同非但不会改变情欲的专一性，反而会强化它。我们一生中充其量只有一次伟大的经历，生活的秘密在于尽可能多地复制伟大的经历。

# Chapter 18

The next day he did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in his own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet indifferent to life itself. The consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down, had begun to dominate him. If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind, he shook. The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets. When he closed his eyes, he saw again the sailor’s face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart.

But perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night, and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him. Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination. It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood. In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak.

第二天他足不出户，说实在，大多呆在自己房间里，病快快地感到极度恐慌，担心自己快要死了，但又对生命本身十分冷漠。一种被追杀、诱捕和跟踪的感觉开始支配着他。壁毯在风中不过动了一下，他便颤抖起来。吹打在铅条玻璃上的枯叶，在他看来酷像自己徒劳的决心和狂乱的悔恨。他一闭上眼睛，便又看到了那海员的脸，隔着雾气迷蒙的窗玻璃窥视着。恐惧似乎再次攫住了他的心。

但也许不过是他幻觉的缘故，黑夜里才闪现了复仇景象，他眼前才展示出惩罚的可怖场面。真实生活是无序的，但想象却有某种严密的逻辑。正是想象使悔恨尾随着罪恶，也正是想象使每一罪恶生出奇形怪状的后代。在平凡的现实世界，恶人得不到惩罚，好人得不到好报。成功被赐给了强者，失败被扔给了弱者。

It was not till the third day that he ventured to go out. There was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life. But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change. His own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm. With subtle and finely-wrought temperaments it is always so. Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on. The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. Besides, he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt.

一直到第三天他才敢出门。的早晨，明净而带松树清香的空气中洋溢着某种东西，恢复了他的欢乐和对生活的热情。但也并不只是环境的物质条件造成了这种变化。他的天性跟过度的痛苦势不两立，因为这种痛苦破坏了他内心的安宁。性格细腻和高雅的人都是如此。强烈的情绪要么碰得鼻青眼肿，要么立即收敛；要么置人于死地，要么自己灭亡。小悲小爱继续生存，大悲大爱则毁灭于自己的充盈。另外，他相信自己是一场噩梦的牺牲品。现在，他回顾自己的忧虑时，是带着惋惜和蔑视的心情的。

‘The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,’ said Lord Henry, lighting a cigarette.
‘You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.’
“凡是丑闻，其根据必定是不道德。”亨利勋爵说着点了一支烟。“你不惜牺牲任何人，哈利，就为了成全自己的一个警句。”
“世人是自愿走向祭坛的。”便是他的回答。

# Chapter 19

‘My dear boy,’ said Lord Henry, smiling, ‘anybody can be good in the country. There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to. There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt. Country people have no opportunity of being either, so they stagnate.’

“好家伙，”亨利勋爵笑了笑说，“在乡下谁都能学好。那里没有诱惑，这也就是乡下人极不开化的原因了。文明绝不是唾手可得的。人要达到文明有两条途径：一条是使自己有教养；另一条是使自己堕落。乡下人两个机会都没有，所以停滞不前。”

Life is not governed by will or intention. Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams. You may fancy yourself safe, and think yourself strong. But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play – I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us. There are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again. 

生活不是受意志或愿望支配的。生活是神经，是纤维，是逐步确立的细胞，在这些东西中，思想把自己掩盖起来，而激情做着自己的梦。你设想自己很安全，认为自己很强大。但是，房间里或是晨空中一抹随意的颜色，你曾经用过并给你带来微妙记忆的某种特定的香水，一首被遗忘的诗歌中你重又见到的一行诗句，你不再弹奏的乐曲中的一个节拍——告诉你吧，道连，我们的生活正是依赖于这些东西的。诗人勃朗宁在什么地方写到过它，不过我们自己的感官会替我们想象的。曾有这样的时刻，一阵丁香的芬芳突然飘来，于是我便又回味一生中最奇特的一个月的日子。

# Chapter 20

The curiously-carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him, so many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round as of old. He took it up, as he had done on that night of horror, when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and with wild tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield. Once, some one who had terribly loved him, had written to him a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words: ‘The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history.’ The phrases came back to his memory, and he repeated them over and over to himself. Then he loathed his own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel. It was his beauty that had ruined him, his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for. But for those two things, his life might have been free from stain. His beauty had been to him but a mask, his youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts. Why had he worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him.

几年前亨利勋爵送他的那面雕刻得很奇特的镜子，此刻放在桌上，四肢雪的小爱神依旧在镜框上笑着。就像在那个可怕的夜晚，他注意到画像致命的变化一样，他拿起了镜子，泪眼模糊地朝光洁的镜子看进去。有一次，一个爱得他要命的人写了一封痴情的信给他，信末是这样两句崇拜得五体投地的话：“世界因为你是象牙和金子做的才变了样，你嘴上的曲线重写了历史。”他想起了这两句话，并不断地回味着。随后他厌恶起自己的美貌来，一下子把镜子扔到了地板上，用鞋跟把它踩成银色的碎片。正是美貌毁了他，而美貌和青春是他所祈求的。要是没有这两者，他的生命也许仍会洁白无瑕。对他来说，美貌不过是假面，青春是一种讽刺。充其量青春是什么呢？是一段幼稚不成熟的时期，一段情绪浅薄、思想病态的时期。为什么他老是穿着青春的号衣呢？青春已经损害了他。
