# Chapter 01

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

From the corner of the divan of Persian saddlebags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect,1 and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. 

The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.

画室里弥漫着浓浓的玫瑰花香，的轻风拂过园中的树木，开着的门便送来了馥郁的紫丁香味，或是满枝粉红色花的荆棘的清香。

亨利．沃登勋爵躺在波斯皮革做的长沙发上，习惯地抽着烟，数不清是第几根了。从沙发的角落望出去，正好看得见像蜜一样甜，又如蜜一般黄的金莲花在闪烁。抖动着的树枝，似乎很难承载花儿火焰一般的美。飞鸟的奇异影子，不时掠过掩着大窗的柞蚕丝绸窗帘，造成了瞬间的日本式效果，令他想起东京那些脸色苍白如玉的画家们。这些人运用必要的静态艺术手段，力求表达一种快速的动感。

蜜蜂沉闷地嗡嗡叫着，穿行在没有刈过、长得很高的青草之间，或是单调地一味围着满地忍冬那金黄色、灰蒙蒙的花蕊打转，似乎使这沉寂愈发压抑了。伦敦模糊的喧闹声，就像远处一架风琴奏出的低音。

房子中间直立的画架上，夹着一张画像，画像中的年轻人美貌绝伦，跟真人一般大。画像前面不远的地方，坐着画家本人，巴兹尔·霍尔华德。几年前，他突然失踪，引起公众的极大兴趣，也招徕了很多奇怪的猜测。

画家打量着他如此巧妙地再现在艺术中的优雅俊秀的形象，满意的笑容闪过脸庞，似乎正要在那儿停留下来。但他突然惊跳起来，闭上了眼睛，手指捂住眼帘，仿佛想把某个奇怪的梦捂进脑子，生怕自己从梦中醒来。

Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.
忠贞不贰的人只知道爱的小零小碎，而见异思迁者才懂得爱的大悲大痛。
