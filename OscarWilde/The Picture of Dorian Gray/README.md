# Chapter 01

The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.

From the corner of the divan of Persian saddlebags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect,1 and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. 

The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.

In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.

As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.

画室里弥漫着浓浓的玫瑰花香，的轻风拂过园中的树木，开着的门便送来了馥郁的紫丁香味，或是满枝粉红色花的荆棘的清香。

亨利．沃登勋爵躺在波斯皮革做的长沙发上，习惯地抽着烟，数不清是第几根了。从沙发的角落望出去，正好看得见像蜜一样甜，又如蜜一般黄的金莲花在闪烁。抖动着的树枝，似乎很难承载花儿火焰一般的美。飞鸟的奇异影子，不时掠过掩着大窗的柞蚕丝绸窗帘，造成了瞬间的日本式效果，令他想起东京那些脸色苍白如玉的画家们。这些人运用必要的静态艺术手段，力求表达一种快速的动感。

蜜蜂沉闷地嗡嗡叫着，穿行在没有刈过、长得很高的青草之间，或是单调地一味围着满地忍冬那金黄色、灰蒙蒙的花蕊打转，似乎使这沉寂愈发压抑了。伦敦模糊的喧闹声，就像远处一架风琴奏出的低音。

房子中间直立的画架上，夹着一张画像，画像中的年轻人美貌绝伦，跟真人一般大。画像前面不远的地方，坐着画家本人，巴兹尔·霍尔华德。几年前，他突然失踪，引起公众的极大兴趣，也招徕了很多奇怪的猜测。

画家打量着他如此巧妙地再现在艺术中的优雅俊秀的形象，满意的笑容闪过脸庞，似乎正要在那儿停留下来。但他突然惊跳起来，闭上了眼睛，手指捂住眼帘，仿佛想把某个奇怪的梦捂进脑子，生怕自己从梦中醒来。

Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love’s tragedies.
忠贞不贰的人只知道爱的小零小碎，而见异思迁者才懂得爱的大悲大痛。

# Chapter 02

‘There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr Gray. All influence is immoral – immoral from the scientific point of view.’

‘Why?’

‘Because to influence a person is to give him one’s own soul. He does not think his natural thoughts, or burn with his natural passions. His virtues are not real to him. His sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. He becomes an echo of some one else’s music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him. The aim of life is self-development. To realize one’s nature perfectly – that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one’s self. Of course they are charitable. They feed the hungry, and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked. Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion – these are the two things that govern us. And yet –’

“世上并没有好影响这样的东西，格雷先生。一切影响都是不道德的——从科学的观点看，不道德。”

“为什么？”

“因为去影响一个人就是把自己的灵魂给了他。他便不会按天性去思考，或者按天性燃起自己的激情。他的美德不真实。他的罪过，要是有的话，也是借来的。他成了别人的音乐的回声，成了这么个演员，扮演着剧本中没有为他而写的角色。生活的目的在于自我发展。充分实现自己的天性——是我们每个人来到世间的目的。如今，人们倒怕起自己来了，忘记了他们的最高职责，也就是对自己应负的责任。当然，他们很慈悲，让饿肚子的吃饱，让要饭的有衣穿。但他们自己的灵魂却在挨饿，赤裸裸一无遮拦。我们的民族失去了勇气，也许从来就并未真有过勇气。害怕社会是道德的基础，害怕上帝是宗教的秘密，就是这两者支配着我们。但是——”

‘And yet,’ continued Lord Henry, in his low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him, and that he had even in his Eton days,3 ‘I believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream – I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediævalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal – to something finer, richer, than the Hellenic ideal, it may be. But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself. The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives.4 We are punished for our refusals. Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind, and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification. Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it. Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful. It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also. You, Mr Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame –’

“但是，”亨利勋爵又往下说，嗓子低沉悦耳。同时他还很有风度地挥了一下手，那是他的一个典型动作，在伊顿公学念书的日子就有了。“我相信，人的一生要是活得充分彻底。人要是抒发一切感情，表达一切思想，实现所有的梦想——我相信，世界将沉浸于新的喜悦之中，于是我们会忘掉中世纪时代的一切弊病，回到希腊的理想中去——也许是一种比希腊的理想更好、更丰富的东西。但我们中的最勇敢分子也害怕自己。那种野蛮自残式的过分克己，不幸还存在，使生活大为减色。我们因为自我克制而遭到了惩罚。想要压制的每个冲动都在头脑中酝酿着，并毒害我们。肉体一旦犯罪，便与罪孽无·缘，因为行动是一种净化的方式。除了回忆的愉悦，悔恨的奢侈，什么都没有留下。摆脱诱惑的惟一办法是向诱惑投降。倘若抵制，灵魂就会得病，病因便是渴望自己所不允的东西，企求那些可怕的法律使其变得可怕和非法的东西。据说，世上的伟大都发自脑袋。在脑袋里，也只有在脑袋里，产生了世间的大罪大恶。你，格雷先生，拿你自己来说吧，你的青年时代像玫瑰一样红，少年时代像玫瑰一样白，你曾产生过让自己害怕的激情，有过令你胆战心惊的念头，做过白梦和夜间梦，只要一想起这些梦来，你会满脸愧色——”

For nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips, and eyes strangely bright. He was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. Yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. The few words that Basil’s friend had said to him – words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them – had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.

Music had stirred him like that. Music had troubled him many times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us. Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them! They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute. Mere words! Was there anything so real as words?

Yes; there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood. He understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him. It seemed to him that he had been walking in fire. Why had he not known it?

大约有十分钟，他一动不动地站在那里，嘴巴张开着，眼睛异样地明亮。他模糊地意识到，内心正接受着一种全新的影响，而这种影响似乎来自于他自己。巴兹尔的朋友同他说的几句话——随口说说的，毫无疑问。话中不乏刻意的悖论——拨动了某根秘密的心弦，这根心弦以前从未触及过，此刻却在奇怪地搏动着。

音乐曾经如此打动过他，无数次折磨过他，但音乐表达得并不清晰，它在我们心里创造的不是一个新世界，而是另一种混乱。话语呀！只不过话语！它多么可怕！多么清楚，多么生动，多么残酷！你无法逃避话语，它蕴含着多么微妙的魔力，似乎能使无形的东西变成有形，似乎自身具有一种音乐，像提琴和诗琴一样动听。而只不过是话语！还有比话语更真实的吗？

不错，年少时他有很多东西不懂，此刻他懂了，忽地觉得生活的色彩像火一样红，仿佛自己向来就在火中行走。但为什么以前一直没有觉察呢？

Lord Henry went out to the garden, and found Dorian Gray burying his face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine. He came close to him, and put his hand upon his shoulder. ‘You are quite right to do that,’ he murmured. ‘Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.’

The lad started and drew back. He was bare-headed, and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads. There was a look of fear in his eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His finely-chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling.

‘Yes,’ continued Lord Henry, ‘that is one of the great secrets of life – to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul. You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.’

Dorian Gray frowned and turned his head away. He could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him. His romantic olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him. There was something in his low, languid voice that was absolutely fascinating. His cool, white, flower-like hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own. But he felt afraid of him, and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself? He had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him. Suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him life’s mystery. And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.

亨利勋爵走出画室，到了花园里。发现道连·格雷把脸埋在硕大凉爽的紫丁香花丛中，喝酒似的拚命吸吮着香气。他走近道连，把手搭在他肩上。“你做得很对，”他低声说，“只有感官才能拯救灵魂，就像只有灵魂才能拯救感官一样。”

小伙子吃了一惊，往后退去。他头上什么也没有戴，树叶撩起了他不听话的鬈发，缠住了金色的发丝。他像一个突然被叫醒的人那样，露出了恐惧的眼神，轮廓分明的鼻孔颤动着，某根隐蔽的神经震撼了他鲜红的嘴唇，弃得它抖个不停。

“是呀，”亨利勋爵继续说，“那是生活的一大秘密——用感官来，拯救灵魂，用灵魂来拯救感官。你是一个了不起的创造。你知道的比你自己设想的要多，就像你知道的比你想要知道的要少一样。”道连·格雷皱了皱眉，转过头去。他禁不住喜欢起身旁这个高高的、风度翩翩的年轻人来。那橄榄色浪漫的脸和疲惫的表情使他兴味盎然。在慢悠悠低沉的嗓音里，有一种极为动人的东西。甚至那白皙、冰凉、花一样的双手，也有一种奇妙的魅力。说话时，他的手像音乐一样流动着，似乎有着自己的语言。但他害怕他，并为害怕而感到惭愧。为什么得让一个陌生人来披露自己的心灵呢？他与巴兹尔相识已有几个月了，但他们之间的并没有改变他。突然问，生活中闯进了一个人，似乎给他揭示了生活的秘密。而这又有什么可怕呢？自己又不是个小学生，要是害怕，那可太荒唐了。

‘It should matter everything to you, Mr Gray.’

‘Why?’

‘Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.’

‘I don’t feel that, Lord Henry.’

‘No, you don’t feel it now. Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so?… You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr Gray. Don’t frown. You have. And Beauty is a form of Genius – is higher, indeed, than Genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won’t smile.… People say sometimes that Beauty is only superficial. That may be so. But at least it is not so superficial as Thought is. To me, Beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible…. Yes, Mr Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly…. Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don’t squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing…. A new Hedonism – that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season…. The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last – such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty, becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!’

“这应当与你息息相关，格雷先生。”

“为什么？”

“因为你享受着最了不起的青春，而青春是值得拥有的。”

“我并没有那种感觉，亨利勋爵。”

“不，你只是现在没有罢了。某一天，等你垂垂老矣，满脸皱纹，丑陋不堪的时候，等思考使你歇顶，把线条刻上你前额的时候，等激情把它可怕的火焰烙上你嘴唇的时候，你会感觉到的，你会强烈地感觉到。现在呢，无论你走到哪里，你会让世界倾倒，难道你能永远这样吗？……你有一张极其漂亮的面孔，格雷先生。别皱眉头，你确实如此。美是天才的一种形式——说真的，高于天才，因为它不需要任何解释。美是世间的一大存在，就像阳光、、或者是映在黑黑的水中，我们称之为的银色贝壳。它不容置疑，它拥有自己神圣的主权，它使占有美的人成为王子。你笑什么？唉，你失去以后就不会、笑了……有时，人会说美是肤浅的，也许如此。但至少不像思想那么肤浅。对我来说，美是奇迹中的奇迹。只有浅薄的人才不以貌取人。世界真正的神秘性在于可见之物，而不在于看不见的东西一乙一是啊，格雷先生，诸神厚爱你，可是诸神赐予你的，会很快被取走。你只有几年时间，能够实实在在，完完美美，充充实实地生活。青春一逝，美也随之而去。到那时，你会突然发现，没有留下胜利的凯歌，或者不得不满足于一些渺小的胜利，而往昔的记忆会使这些胜利比失败还要痛苦。月复一月，美渐渐衰朽，某种可怕的东西接踵而至。时间妒忌你，战争跟你的美貌作对。你脸色灰黄，两颊下陷，目光迟钝。你会感到无限痛苦……啊！你拥有青春的时候，就要感受它。不要虚掷你的黄金时代，不要去倾听枯燥乏味的东西，不要设法挽救无望的失败，不要把你的生命献给无知、平庸和低俗。这些都是我们时代病态的目标，虚假的理想。活着！把你宝贵的内在生命活出来。什么都别错过。不断寻找新的感受，什么都不要怕……一种新的享乐主义——那正是我们的世纪所缺乏的。你也许是它看得见的象征。有你这样的个性，你什么都干得成。世界只属于你一个季节……我遇见你的那一刻，我看得出，你并没有十分意识到自己是怎样一个人，实际上可以成为怎样一个人。你身上有那么多东西让我着迷，所以我觉得必须把某些关系到你的事告诉你。我想，要是你虚度了青春，那该有多不幸。因为你的青春岁月所剩无多——只有那么一点点时间了。普通的山花谢了又开，明年六月，金莲花会像现在这样开得金黄。再过一个月，铁线莲会长出似的紫色花朵，一年又一年，绿色的叶子支撑着紫色的。但我们的青春却一去不返。二十岁时，脉搏跳得很欢，现在却微弱无力了。我们的四肢废了，感官坏了。．我们衰变成了可怕的傀儡，只剩下记忆中令我们害怕的激情，以及我们没有胆量接受的巨大诱惑，依然拂之不去。青春啊，青春！除了青春，世上什么也没有！”

# Chapter 03

So that was the story of Dorian Gray’s parentage. Crudely as it had been told to him, it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance. A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime. Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man. Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him more perfect as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic. Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow…. And how charming he had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face. Talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin. He answered to every touch and thrill of the bow…. There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence.6 No other activity was like it. To project one’s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one’s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one’s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that – perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims…. He was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he had met in Basil’s studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate. Grace was his, and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing that one could not do with him. He could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade!… And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he was! The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryad-like and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was! He remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analysed it? Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence?7 But in our own century it was strange…. Yes; he would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait. He would seek to dominate him – had already, indeed, half done so. He would make that wonderful spirit his own. There was something fascinating in this son of Love and Death.

这就是道连·格雷双亲的故事。讲述得十分粗略，却因为暗示着一段离奇而近乎现代的罗曼史，深深打动了他。一个漂亮的女人，为了疯狂的恋情而不顾一切。几周如痴如狂的甜蜜日子，被一桩奸诈丑恶的罪行所打断。挨过几个月无言的痛苦之后，一个婴儿在阵痛中出世了。死亡夺走了母亲，把孤苦伶仃的男孩留给了专横冷酷的老人。是啊，这是一个有趣的背景，烘托出了那男孩，使他更为完美。每一件赏心悦目的东西背后，总有一段悲哀的隐情。连最不起眼的小花要开放，世界也得经历阵痛。昨夜俱乐部的晚餐上，道连格雷多么富有魅力，坐在对面，沉浸在惊喜之中，目光愕然，双唇张开。红色的烛罩，把他那令人惊叹的面容映照得像一朵红红的玫瑰。跟他交谈，就好像拉一把精制的小提琴，琴弓的一推一拉，一抖一动，都会得到呼应……把影响施与别人真令人兴奋，确实无与伦比。把自己的灵魂投射进某种高雅的东西里，并让它在那里逗留一会儿；听到自己理性的见解产生了伴有激情和青春的音乐的回响；把自己的气质像一种微妙的流体或是奇异的香气那样，灌注进另一种气质；这些都给人一种真正的快乐，在我们这个如此局促、如此庸俗的时代，这个声色犬马、缺乏志向的时代，那也许是一种最舒心的快乐……他在巴兹尔画室巧遇的这个小伙子，还是一个了不起的典型，或者至少可以塑造成一个了不起的典型。他很高雅，具有古老的希腊大理石雕刻所保留的童稚般的纯真和美丽。你把他塑造成什么都行，可以做成巨神泰坦，也可以做成小玩具。多么可惜啊，这样的美竟注定要消失！……而巴兹尔呢？从心理学角度看，他真有意思！新的艺术技巧，观察生活的新的视角，出奇地因为某个人在场而得到了启发，而这个人自己却浑然不觉。沉默的精灵住在昏暗的林地里，毫无踪影地在空旷的走来走去，突然间像树神德律阿德斯那样显形了，而且一点也不害怕，因为画家的灵魂在寻觅着她。此刻，在他的灵魂中唤起了一种奇妙的情景，惟有在这种情景中，奇妙的东西才能够显现。于是，事物的形状和风格一定程度上变得高雅了，获得了某种象征意义，仿佛它们本身成了另一种更完美的东西的风格，使其从影子变成了实体。这一切真不可思议！他记起了历史上类似的情况。不是那位沉思型艺术家柏拉图首先这么分析的吗？波纳洛蒂不是把它刻在写有十四行组诗的彩色大理石上吗？但在我们这个世纪，这是不可理解的……是呀，就像道连·格雷不知不觉中影响着这位画家，使他创作出了出色的画像那样，他竭力要去影响道连·格雷。他要设法去控制他，事实上他已经成功了一半。他要得到那个奇妙的精灵。这个爱情和死亡的结晶，有着某种迷人的东西。

He played with the idea, and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy, and winged it with paradox. The praise of folly, as he went on, soared into a philosophy, and Philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of Pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante8 over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober. Facts fled before her like frightened forest things. Her white feet trod the huge press at which wise Omar9 sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat’s black, dripping, sloping sides. It was an extraordinary improvisation. He felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him, and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate, seemed to give his wit keenness, and to lend colour to his imagination. He was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He charmed his listeners out of themselves, and they followed his pipe laughing. Dorian Gray never took his gaze off him, but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his lips, and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes.

他把玩着这个想法，变得任性自恃起来，把它丢到空中，变换个样子，一会儿放走它，一会把它捉回来，用幻想使它闪光，用悖论使它飞翔。他这么玩着玩着，对愚蠢的赞颂竟幻化成了一种哲学，而哲学自己则变得年轻起来，如我们所能想象的那样，穿上酒迹斑斑的长袍，戴了常青藤花冠，踏着疯狂的欢快乐曲，像酒神的女祭司那样，在生命的小山上跳起舞来，嘲笑迟钝的赛利纳斯依然十分清醒。事实犹如受惊的森林，在她面前纷纷逃走了。她那白皙的脚，踩着巨大的酒榨机，机上坐着智者奥默，她踩呀踩呀，直到葡萄的汁水奥：波斯诗人和天文学家，著有诗歌《鲁拜集》，好以饮酒忘却死亡和对上帝的失望。泛起一阵阵紫色的泡沫，涌到她光着的脚周围，或者红色的酒泡溢出酒桶，滴在黑色倾斜的桶腰上。这是一件出色的即兴之作。他觉得道连·格雷目不转睛地看着他。由于意识到自己希望迷住听众中某个人的心，他的才思更加敏捷，他的想象更富有色彩。他才华横溢，浮想联翩，毫无顾忌。他使听者为之倾倒。他们跟着他的风笛笑个不停。道连·格雷始终盯着他，着了魔似地坐着，阵阵微笑掠过嘴唇，渐渐暗淡的眼神里出现了越来越惊讶的表情。

# Chapter 04

‘My dear boy, no woman is a genius. Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.’
“我的好家伙，没有一个女人是天才。女性是善于装饰的，她们从来没有话要说，却可以说得非常动人。女人代表物质对思想的胜利，正如男人代表思想对道德的胜利。”

My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people. What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect – simply a confession of failure. Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up. B

“我的好家伙，一生中只爱一次的人是真正的浅薄者。他们自称为忠实和忠贞的，我管它叫习惯性的懒散，或是缺乏想像力。忠实之于情感生活，犹如一致性之于理智生活，纯粹是失败的自供状。什么忠实！将来我必须加以研究。里面包藏着一种贪财欲。要是不怕别人捡走，有很多东西我们准会扔掉"

Dorian Gray leaped to his feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes. ‘Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!’

‘It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,’ said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his voice. ‘But why should you be annoyed? I suppose she will belong to you some day. When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one’s self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance. You know her, at any rate, I suppose?’

道连．格雷跳了起来，脸色通红，目光如火。“哈利，西比尔文是圣洁的！”

“只有圣洁的东西才值得去碰它，道连，”亨利勋爵说，话音里带着一丝莫名的悲哀。“可是你为什么要恼火呢？我想她迟早要属于你的。一个人恋爱的时候总是以自欺欺人开始，而以欺骗别人告终。这就是世人所说的罗曼史。无论怎么说，我想你是了解她的喽？”

As he left the room, Lord Henry’s heavy eyelids drooped, and he began to think. Certainly few people had ever interested him so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad’s mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy. He was pleased by it. It made him a more interesting study. He had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science,14 but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import. And so he had begun by vivisecting himself, as he had ended by vivisecting others. Human life – that appeared to him the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one’s face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them. There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received! How wonderful the whole world became to one! To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect – to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord – there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.

He was conscious – and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyes – that it was through certain words of his, musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray’s soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her. To a large extent the lad was his own creation.He had made him premature. That was something. Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away. Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect. But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, Life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.

Yes, the lad was premature. He was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him, but he was becoming self-conscious. It was delightful to watch him. With his beautiful face, and his beautiful soul, he was a thing to wonder at. It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. He was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one’s sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.

Soul and body, body and soul – how mysterious they were! There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade. Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists! And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin? Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.

He began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us. As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves, and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes. Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid. But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.

It was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results. His sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest. There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences; yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion. What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous. It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious. It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves.

亨利勋爵离开房间的时候垂下了厚重的眼睑，陷入了沉思。显然很少有人像道连·格雷那样使他感兴趣。可是那小伙子对另外一个人发疯似的爱，并没有给他带来一丝因烦恼或嫉妒所生的痛苦。他感到高兴，因为道连成了更有意思的研究对象。他经常被自然科学的方法所吸引，却又觉得自然科学的一般论题太琐细，也太无意义。于是他先是解剖自己，末了又去解剖别人。他觉得人类的生活是一件值得探究的事。与此相比，其他东西都是没有价值的。事实是这样，当一个人看着生活奇怪地受着痛苦和愉快的煎熬的时候，他脸上无法佩戴玻璃假面具，也不可能阻止硫磺的烟雾熏得脑袋一片混沌，把想象搅成乱七八糟的幻想和梦呓。有些毒药难以捉摸，要了解它的性质，你自己也得中毒。有些疾病非常奇怪，要作出诊断，你必得亲身去体验。然而，你得到了何等巨大的报偿！世界对于你变得多么奇妙！要了解激情的铁一般的奇异逻辑，要知道理智的多情多彩的生活，要观察它们什么地方相遇，什么地方分离，哪一点上一致，哪一点上相左，是一种乐趣！又何必管它要付出多大的代价？为了得到一种新的感觉，再高的代价也是值得的。

他意识到，正是他的某些话，用音乐般的音调说出的音乐似的话，使道连·格雷的灵魂转向这位纯洁的姑娘，并为之倾倒。这么想，他玛瑙似的褐色眼睛里射出了喜悦的光芒。这小伙子很大程度上是他的创造物。他使他早熟，那很了不起。普通人等待着生活把秘密暴露给他们，而对少数人，对上帝的选民来说，生活的面纱还没有拉开，内中的秘密就尽收眼底了。有时，那是艺术所产生的效果，主要是文学艺术，因为它直接表现激情和理智。但有时一个复杂的人取而代之，担当起了艺术的职能，事实上，其自身便是一件艺术品。像诗歌、雕塑和绘画一样，生活本身就拥有精心创造的杰作。

不错，这小伙子有些早熟，就已开始了收获。他身上涌动着青春的脉搏和热情，但他的自我意识已经很强。对他进行观察是一种愉快。那么漂亮的脸蛋，那么美丽的灵魂，他使你为之惊叹。至于如何结局，或者注定要如何了结，都无关紧要。他就像露天表演或戏剧中的高雅角色，他们的欢乐似乎离你非常遥远，他们的忧愁却会激起你的美感，他们的伤痛像红红的玫瑰。

灵魂和肉体，肉体和灵魂，是多么神秘呀！灵魂中存在着性，肉体中有瞬时的灵性。感觉可以升华，理智可能堕落。谁能说得出何处是肉体冲动的终点，何处是灵魂冲动的起点？一般心理学家的武断定义是何等浅薄！然而要对不派的主张决定取舍又何其困难！难道灵魂是端坐在罪恶之屋中的幽灵？或者如乔达诺。布鲁诺所想，肉体真的是在灵魂里？把精神从物质中分离出来是一大秘密，精神和物质的统一也是一大秘密。

他开始考虑我们是否能使心理学彻底成为一门科学，向我们揭示生活的一切动力。我们似乎常常误解自己，也很少理解别人。经验不具有伦理价值。它只不过是人赐给错误的名字。道德学家总是把它视为一种警示，认为他对性格的培养具有一定的伦理效果，赞扬它教育我们应该遵循什么，启发我们应当避免什么。但是经验中没有动力。它像良心一样不是一种积极因素。它实际所昭示的，无非是我们的未来与我们的过去一模一样，我们一度犯过并十分厌恶的罪孽，我们又会愉快地一犯再犯。

他很清楚，实验法是对情欲作出科学分析的惟一方法。自然道连·格雷是他手头的一个专题，而且有可能得到丰富的成果。他对西比尔。文那种突如其来的痴心，是一个很有意思的心理现象。无疑这与好奇心有密切关系，对一种新体验的好奇和向往。然而它不是简单而是相当复杂的情欲。原本存在的孩提时代的感官本能，通过想象转化成为对这个青年来说远离感官的东西，也正因为这样就显得更加危险。关于情欲的来源，我们有些自欺欺人，但正是这种情欲有力地支配着我们。我们最弱的动机是那些我们意识到其本质的动机。事情常常是这样，当我们认为是在对别人进行试验的时候，实际上是在对自己进行着试验。

The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her voice. Her eyes caught the melody, and echoed it in radiance: then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret. When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.

Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense. She did not listen. She was free in her prison of passion. Her prince, Prince Charming, was with her. She had called on Memory to remake him. She had sent her soul to search for him, and it had brought him back. His kiss burned again upon her mouth. Her eyelids were warm with his breath.

Then Wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This young man might be rich. If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her. She saw the thin lips moving, and smiled.

这姑娘又大笑起来。嗓音里透出了笼中鸟般的喜悦。她的眼睛抓住了这美妙的旋律，产生了共鸣，闪烁出明亮的目光。随后闭了一会儿，仿佛要掩盖内心的秘密。再次张开的时候，眸子里飘过一阵梦幻似的雾翳。

薄唇利舌的智慧坐在旧椅子上同她说话，暗示她要谨慎，还引述了一本借用常识之名写成的《懦弱》一书。她置之不理。在激情的牢狱中她是自由的。她的王子，迷人王子，同她在一起。她召唤记忆来重塑王子的形象，派出灵魂去寻找他，并把他带了回来。他的亲吻再次在她嘴上燃烧，她的眼睑留着他呼吸的余温。

然后，智慧改变了手法，主张探秘和发现。这年轻人也许很有钱，要是这样，婚姻就应当考虑。世俗的狡狯，波浪似地撞击着她的耳壳，诡计的箭矢，从她身边滑过。她看到智慧的薄唇在抖动和微笑。
