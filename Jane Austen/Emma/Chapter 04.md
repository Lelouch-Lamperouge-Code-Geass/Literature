Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.

哈里特当然并不聪明，不过她具有顺从知恩的天性，她绝对没有一丝自负的因素，唯一的愿望便是接受某个高高在上者的指引。最初，她与她的关系非常亲切。她需要伴侣，欣赏美雅聪明；结果证明，尽管不能指望这孩子有很高的理解水平，但她却不乏鉴赏能力。她完全确信哈里特-史密斯恰好是她所需要的年轻伴侣-完全是她的家所要求的。这种需求已经完全不可能由韦斯顿太太来满足了，这两层需求她不可能满足，这两种角色她也不愿意承担。她们类型完全不同-情感方面的性质不同，不能相提并论。韦斯顿太太是她感激和尊敬的人。哈里特则是她热爱并且认为有用的人。她不必为韦斯顿太太做任何事，办事对哈里特，她一切都得做。

"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good–humour with it—but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good–humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"

She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.

“从某种意义上讲，埃尔顿先生的风度或许胜过奈特里先生和维斯顿先生，但是他们更多些文雅。把他们当作典型或许更恰当。韦斯顿先生的性情开朗，思维敏捷，近乎直截了当，大家因而都喜欢他，以为他幽默诙谐——但是照样模仿他就不合适了。奈特里先生那种直率、果断、居高临下的风度也是不能模仿的——尽管对他来说非常合适，因为他的体态、容貌和生活地位似乎允许这么做。但是，假如任何一个年轻人模仿他的风度，那可实在难以忍受。与此相反，照我的想法，一个年轻人如果以埃尔顿先生为样板，那将是比较适宜的。埃尔顿先生脾气和蔼，天性欢乐，态度殷勤，举止文雅。在我看来，他好象进来变得尤其文雅了，哈勒特，我不知道他是否刻意迎合我们两人中的那一位他的温文儒雅比以前更甚，让我感到惊异。假如他真的有意，我以前没告诉你他是怎么评论你的吗？”

接着她重复引用埃尔顿先生对她的热情赞扬，这些话现在充分起作用了。哈里特绯红脸颊，泛出了微笑，说她从来就认为埃尔顿先生非常平易近人。
