Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty–one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.

She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage, been mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.

Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her own.

The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.

Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding–day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride–people gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.

The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self–denying, generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old—how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health—and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well–informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault.

爱玛-伍德豪斯小姐端庄儒雅、才思敏捷、生性欢乐、家境宽裕，仿佛上苍将最美好的恩赐集中施与她一身了。她在这世界已经生活了将近二十一年，极少遭遇到苦恼或伤心的事情。

她是两姊妹中年幼的一个，父亲是一位极富慈爱心人，对女儿无比娇惯溺爱。姐姐出嫁后，她早早便担当起家庭女主人的角色。她母亲很久以前就去世了，母亲的爱抚仅仅给她留下一点儿十分模糊的记忆。一位杰出的家庭女教师填补了母亲的空缺，它给与的母爱绝不亚于一位母亲。

泰勒小姐在伍德豪斯家生活已经有十六年，她不仅是个家庭女教师，更是这个家庭的朋友。她非常喜爱两位姑娘，尤其喜欢爱玛。在她们两人之间，姐妹亲情胜于师生关系。泰勒小姐脾气温和，即使在原来执教时期，也难得强加什么限制，现在，教师的权威早已烟消云散，他们就像相依为命的朋友一样生活在一起，挨骂喜欢做什么完全由着自己的性子来，虽然她高度尊重泰勒小姐的判断，但是决定主要由自己作主。……（此处有45字不通顺）

悲哀降临了——仅仅是个轻微的悲哀而已——而且还不是以痛苦的方式降临的——泰勒小姐出嫁了，首先感到的是失去泰勒小姐的悲伤，在这位亲爱的朋友结婚的日子里，爱玛才第一次坐下悲哀的想象着未来，婚礼过后新人离去，饭桌上只剩下父亲和她，不可能指望有第三个人在漫长的夜晚来活跃气氛，她父亲饭后编造早上床安息，她只有自己在炉前痛惜自己的损失。

她的朋友在这桩婚姻中面临着种种幸福的前景，维斯顿先生的品格无懈可击，财产富足，年纪适中，态度谦和，爱玛想到自己向来希望本着自我牺牲精神和慷慨的友谊促成这桩婚姻，就感到些许满足，但是那天早上的活动对她来说却是阴郁的，每天的每个时辰都感到需要泰勒小姐，她回忆其她慈祥的音容笑貌——十六年来一直地那样和蔼慈祥——及其自己五岁其她便开始教授知识，陪自己做游戏——回忆起她在自己健康时不惜贡献出全部能力，为了使她高兴而时时相伴——在自己幼年生各种疾病时更是百般照料，无微不至，为此她心中时常洋溢感激之情；在伊莎贝拉出嫁后的七年间，家里只剩下她们两人，两人平等相待，毫无保留，那更是亲切美好的回忆。那是个非常难得的朋友加伴侣，富有才华，知识丰富。乐于主人，态度谦和，对家庭的一切都了如指掌，对家里关心的所有事务全都十分不感兴趣——爱玛尽可以将自己的各种念头统统倾诉给她，而绝对不会发现她的慈爱会产生任何瑕疵。
  
Real, long–standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing–room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
  
韦斯顿夫妇和奈特里先生来访是出于真挚而持久的关系；一位肚子生活却不堪孤独的年轻人埃尔顿先生来访，则是想以伍德豪斯先生家雅致客厅中的社交活动，以及他女儿的嫣然微笑，填补自己闲暇夜晚的空虚孤寂，这种特权决不会面临抛出门外的危险。

Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good–will. It was her own universal good–will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.

贝茨太太是海伯里过去一位牧师的遗孀，她的年纪实在太大了，处了喝茶打扑克外，几乎什么也做不了。他与自己的独生女儿在一起过着非常单调的生活。尽管处在这种不幸的境遇中，却仍然能激起大家对一位无为的老太太所能产生的全部敬意。她女儿是一位即不年轻漂亮，有不富有的未婚女子，却受到非同一般的爱戴。贝茨小姐受到的恩惠其实使她处于最糟不过的窘境，她本人缺乏自知之明也不会威胁那些可能憎恨他的人们，让他们表面上对她表示尊敬。她从来没有让人感到容貌上的美，也没有在心智方面有聪明过人的表现。她的年轻时代在不知不觉中逝去了，她的中年时光全都贡献给照顾衰弱的母亲，以及设法将一笔微小的收入尽可能派各种达用场。不过，她是个愉快的女人，任何人提起她时心中都不乏善意。创造如此奇迹的正是她自己无时不在的善意和知足的天性。她热爱每一个人，对每一个人的幸福都关怀备至，对每个人的优点特别敏感关注。她认为自己是最幸福的人，依傍如此杰出的米亲而沉浸在大家的祝福中，周围不但有如此众多的好邻居和好朋友，而且自己还有一个什么都不缺的家。她有纯朴而欢乐的天性，她有知足而感恩的精神，这些便是她与别人交往的桥梁，也是她自己深感幸运的宝藏。她能就芝麻小事夸夸其谈，这正好符合伍德豪斯先生的胃口，因为那时些琐细的交流和无害的闲言碎语。

She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.

She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very creditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. She would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in–betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper–table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good–will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.


她是个非常漂亮的姑娘，再说，她的容貌类型恰好是爱玛所推崇的。她的身材矮小丰满，金发碧眼，皮肤百嫩，脸颊红润，五官端正，表情显得极为甜美。不到夜阑人尽时，爱玛对她的举止仪态的喜爱已不亚于喜欢她的外貌，心中已经打定主意要保持关系。

虽然她并没有为史密斯小姐谈吐中显著的睿智感到惊讶，却发现她非常迷人——没有让人不舒服的羞怯，也并非不善交谈——然而远没有显得冒昧，她举止得体，表现出敬意，为自己等够被带进哈特费尔德宅子来满心欢喜，充满感激之情。这里的一切物品风格都比她熟悉的东西高雅，她毫不做作地显得很着迷。爱玛认为她一定具有良知，值得鼓励，而且也应当培养。那对柔和的蓝眼睛和全部的天然丽质，不应当埋没在海伯里及其周围的下等阶层中。她业已结交的熟人全都配不上她。她刚刚离开的学友尽管是些很好的人，但是肯定对她有害。那家人们是奈特里先生的佃户，租种着他大片土地——她相信，他们非常厚道——她还知道，奈特里先生对他们的评价相当高——不过，他们准是些粗俗不雅的人，根本不适合跟一位知识和风度几近完美的姑娘进行紧密交往。她要注意这位姑娘，让她得到提高，让她与不雅的熟人分手，把她介绍给上流社会，她要让她形成自己的观点和风范。这将是一件有趣的事，肯定是一桩善举，准会成为生活中的寄托和乐趣，还可以显示出自己的能力。

她沉浸在对那双柔和的蓝眼睛的赞美中，专心致志于交谈和倾听，脑子里忙着构思自己的帮助计划，结果夜晚的时光以非同寻常的速度飞逝而去。她一向习惯于盯着表，盼望晚餐摆好，好给这种晚会画上句号，今天在不知不觉中发现桌子早已摆设停当，移到炉火旁边。尽管她对认真做好任何事情从不持冷漠态度，然而今天她敏捷的动作远远超过平时。她的计划让她喜伤心头激发出真正的善意，，她一再劝大家多吃鸡肉丁和干贝肉。她知道，她的催促虽急，客人们却乐于接受，因为大家都盼望能早早回家上床，又唯恐动作太急有失斯文。

Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted—exactly the something which her home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.

哈里特当然并不聪明，不过她具有顺从知恩的天性，她绝对没有一丝自负的因素，唯一的愿望便是接受某个高高在上者的指引。最初，她与她的关系非常亲切。她需要伴侣，欣赏美雅聪明；结果证明，尽管不能指望这孩子有很高的理解水平，但她却不乏鉴赏能力。她完全确信哈里特-史密斯恰好是她所需要的年轻伴侣-完全是她的家所要求的。这种需求已经完全不可能由韦斯顿太太来满足了，这两层需求她不可能满足，这两种角色她也不愿意承担。她们类型完全不同-情感方面的性质不同，不能相提并论。韦斯顿太太是她感激和尊敬的人。哈里特则是她热爱并且认为有用的人。她不必为韦斯顿太太做任何事，办事对哈里特，她一切都得做。

"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him, because there is so much good–humour with it—but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good–humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?"

She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.

“从某种意义上讲，埃尔顿先生的风度或许胜过奈特里先生和维斯顿先生，但是他们更多些文雅。把他们当作典型或许更恰当。韦斯顿先生的性情开朗，思维敏捷，近乎直截了当，大家因而都喜欢他，以为他幽默诙谐——但是照样模仿他就不合适了。奈特里先生那种直率、果断、居高临下的风度也是不能模仿的——尽管对他来说非常合适，因为他的体态、容貌和生活地位似乎允许这么做。但是，假如任何一个年轻人模仿他的风度，那可实在难以忍受。与此相反，照我的想法，一个年轻人如果以埃尔顿先生为样板，那将是比较适宜的。埃尔顿先生脾气和蔼，天性欢乐，态度殷勤，举止文雅。在我看来，他好象进来变得尤其文雅了，哈勒特，我不知道他是否刻意迎合我们两人中的那一位他的温文儒雅比以前更甚，让我感到惊异。假如他真的有意，我以前没告诉你他是怎么评论你的吗？”

接着她重复引用埃尔顿先生对她的热情赞扬，这些话现在充分起作用了。哈里特绯红脸颊，泛出了微笑，说她从来就认为埃尔顿先生非常平易近人。

"Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being "the picture of health;" now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown–up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?"

“多美的眼睛！——纯粹的单褐色——多么明亮！五官端正，容貌开朗，肤色洁白！啊！脸色健康红润像盛开的花朵，身体的高度和各部分搭配如此匀称，提醒多么高挑稳健。她的健康不仅表现在红润的脸色，而且体现在她的头发光泽、她的头型、她的回眸。有时候人们说，某个孩子像‘画里的健康娃娃’一样。在我的脑子里，爱玛从来就是一幅典型的成年健康姑娘图画。她就是可爱的化身。奈特里先生，难道不是吗？”
