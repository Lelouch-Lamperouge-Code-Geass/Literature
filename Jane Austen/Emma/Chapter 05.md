"Such an eye!—the true hazle eye—and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her glance. One hears sometimes of a child being "the picture of health;" now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown–up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?"

“多美的眼睛！——纯粹的单褐色——多么明亮！五官端正，容貌开朗，肤色洁白！啊！脸色健康红润像盛开的花朵，身体的高度和各部分搭配如此匀称，提醒多么高挑稳健。她的健康不仅表现在红润的脸色，而且体现在她的头发光泽、她的头型、她的回眸。有时候人们说，某个孩子像‘画里的健康娃娃’一样。在我的脑子里，爱玛从来就是一幅典型的成年健康姑娘图画。她就是可爱的化身。奈特里先生，难道不是吗？”
