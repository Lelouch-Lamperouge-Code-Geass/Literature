Real, long–standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing–room, and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.

韦斯顿夫妇和奈特里先生来访是出于真挚而持久的关系；一位肚子生活却不堪孤独的年轻人埃尔顿先生来访，则是想以伍德豪斯先生家雅致客厅中的社交活动，以及他女儿的嫣然微笑，填补自己闲暇夜晚的空虚孤寂，这种特权决不会面临抛出门外的危险。

Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good–will. It was her own universal good–will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.

贝茨太太是海伯里过去一位牧师的遗孀，她的年纪实在太大了，处了喝茶打扑克外，几乎什么也做不了。他与自己的独生女儿在一起过着非常单调的生活。尽管处在这种不幸的境遇中，却仍然能激起大家对一位无为的老太太所能产生的全部敬意。她女儿是一位即不年轻漂亮，有不富有的未婚女子，却受到非同一般的爱戴。贝茨小姐受到的恩惠其实使她处于最糟不过的窘境，她本人缺乏自知之明也不会威胁那些可能憎恨他的人们，让他们表面上对她表示尊敬。她从来没有让人感到容貌上的美，也没有在心智方面有聪明过人的表现。她的年轻时代在不知不觉中逝去了，她的中年时光全都贡献给照顾衰弱的母亲，以及设法将一笔微小的收入尽可能派各种达用场。不过，她是个愉快的女人，任何人提起她时心中都不乏善意。创造如此奇迹的正是她自己无时不在的善意和知足的天性。她热爱每一个人，对每一个人的幸福都关怀备至，对每个人的优点特别敏感关注。她认为自己是最幸福的人，依傍如此杰出的米亲而沉浸在大家的祝福中，周围不但有如此众多的好邻居和好朋友，而且自己还有一个什么都不缺的家。她有纯朴而欢乐的天性，她有知足而感恩的精神，这些便是她与别人交往的桥梁，也是她自己深感幸运的宝藏。她能就芝麻小事夸夸其谈，这正好符合伍德豪斯先生的胃口，因为那时些琐细的交流和无害的闲言碎语。

She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.

She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging—not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk—and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell—very creditably, she believed—she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them—but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. She would notice her; she would improve her; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in–betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper–table, which always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good–will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.

她是个非常漂亮的姑娘，再说，她的容貌类型恰好是爱玛所推崇的。她的身材矮小丰满，金发碧眼，皮肤百嫩，脸颊红润，五官端正，表情显得极为甜美。不到夜阑人尽时，爱玛对她的举止仪态的喜爱已不亚于喜欢她的外貌，心中已经打定主意要保持关系。

虽然她并没有为史密斯小姐谈吐中显著的睿智感到惊讶，却发现她非常迷人——没有让人不舒服的羞怯，也并非不善交谈——然而远没有显得冒昧，她举止得体，表现出敬意，为自己等够被带进哈特费尔德宅子来满心欢喜，充满感激之情。这里的一切物品风格都比她熟悉的东西高雅，她毫不做作地显得很着迷。爱玛认为她一定具有良知，值得鼓励，而且也应当培养。那对柔和的蓝眼睛和全部的天然丽质，不应当埋没在海伯里及其周围的下等阶层中。她业已结交的熟人全都配不上她。她刚刚离开的学友尽管是些很好的人，但是肯定对她有害。那家人们是奈特里先生的佃户，租种着他大片土地——她相信，他们非常厚道——她还知道，奈特里先生对他们的评价相当高——不过，他们准是些粗俗不雅的人，根本不适合跟一位知识和风度几近完美的姑娘进行紧密交往。她要注意这位姑娘，让她得到提高，让她与不雅的熟人分手，把她介绍给上流社会，她要让她形成自己的观点和风范。这将是一件有趣的事，肯定是一桩善举，准会成为生活中的寄托和乐趣，还可以显示出自己的能力。

她沉浸在对那双柔和的蓝眼睛的赞美中，专心致志于交谈和倾听，脑子里忙着构思自己的帮助计划，结果夜晚的时光以非同寻常的速度飞逝而去。她一向习惯于盯着表，盼望晚餐摆好，好给这种晚会画上句号，今天在不知不觉中发现桌子早已摆设停当，移到炉火旁边。尽管她对认真做好任何事情从不持冷漠态度，然而今天她敏捷的动作远远超过平时。她的计划让她喜伤心头激发出真正的善意，，她一再劝大家多吃鸡肉丁和干贝肉。她知道，她的催促虽急，客人们却乐于接受，因为大家都盼望能早早回家上床，又唯恐动作太急有失斯文。
