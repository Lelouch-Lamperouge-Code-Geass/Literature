## ECONOMY

* I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live a man's life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well-nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and woodlot! The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh. 看见青年人，我的市民同胞，他们的不幸是，生下地来就继承了田地、庐舍、谷仓、牛羊和农具；得到它们倒是容易，舍弃它们可困难了。他们不如诞生在空旷的牧场上，让狼来给他们喂奶，他们倒能够看清楚了，自己是在何等的环境辛勤劳动。谁使他们变成了土地的奴隶？为什么有人能够享受六十英亩田地的供养，而更多人却命定了，只能啄食尘土呢？为什么他们刚生下地，就得自掘坟墓？他们不能不过人的生活，不能不推动这一切，一个劲儿地做工，尽可能地把光景过得好些。我曾遇见过多少个可怜的、永生的灵魂啊，几乎被压死在生命的负担下面，他们无法呼吸，他们在生命道上爬动，推动他们前面的一个七十五英尺长，四十英尺宽的大谷仓，一个从未打扫过的奥吉亚斯的牛圈，还要推动上百英亩土地，锄地、芟草，还要放牧和护林！可是，另一些并没有继承产业的人，固然没有这种上代传下的、不必要的磨难，却也得为他们几立方英尺的血肉之躯，委屈地生活，拼性命地做工哪。

* Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers, from excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually, the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember well his ignorance -- which his growth requires -- who has so often to use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly. 　大多数人，即使是在这个比较自由的国土上的人们，也仅仅因为无知和错误，满载着虚构的忧虑，忙不完的粗活，却不能采集生命的美果。操劳过度，使他们的手指粗笨了，颤抖得又大厉害，不适用于采集了。真的，劳动的人，一天又一天，找不到空闲来使得自己真正地完整无损；他无法保持人与人间最勇毅的关系；他的劳动，一到市场上，总是跌价。除了做一架机器之外，他没时间来做别的。他怎能记得他是无知的呢——他是全靠他的无知而活下的——他不经常绞尽脑汁吗？在评说他们之前，我们先要兔费地使他穿暖、吃饱，并用我们的兴奋剂使他恢复健康。我们天性中最优美的品格，好比果实上的粉霜一样，是只能轻手轻脚，才得保全的。然而，人与人之间就是没有能如此温柔地相处。

* Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does any divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses! What is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate. 看大路上的赶马人，日夜向市场赶路，在他们的内心里，有什么神圣的思想在激荡着呢？他们的最高职责是给驴马饲草饮水！和运输的赢利相比较，他们的命运算什么？他们还不是在给一位繁忙的绅士赶驴马？他们有什么神圣，有什么不朽呢？请看他们匍伏潜行，一整天里战战兢兢，毫不是神圣的，也不是不朽的，他们看到自己的行业，知道自己是属于奴隶或囚徒这种名称的人。和我们的自知之明相比较，公众这暴戾的君主也显得微弱无力。正是一个人怎么看待自己，决定了此人的命运，指向了他的归宿。

* The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things. 人类在过着静静的绝望的生活。所谓听天由命，正是肯定的绝望。你从绝望的城市走到绝望的村庄，以水貂和麝鼠的勇敢来安慰自己。在人类的所谓游戏与消遣底下，甚至都隐藏着一种凝固的、不知又不觉的绝望。两者中都没有娱乐可言，因为工作之后才能娱乐。可是不绝望的事，才是智慧的一种表征。

* When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. 　当我们用教义问答法的方式，思考着什么是人生的宗旨，什么是生活的真正的必需品与资料时，仿佛人们还曾审慎从事地选择了这种生活的共同方式，而不要任何别的方式似的。其实他们也知道，舍此而外，别无可以挑选的方式。但清醒健康的人都知道，太阳终古常新。抛弃我们的偏见，是永远不会来不及的。无论如何古老的思想与行为，除非有确证，便不可以轻信。在今天人人附和或以为不妨默认的真理，很可能在明天变成虚无缥缈的氤氲，但还会有人是乌云，可以将一阵甘霖洒落到大地上来。

* All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false colors, and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that of mankind. 人之所需，并不是要做些事，而是要有所为，或是说，需有所是。也许我们是永远不必添置新衣服的，不论旧衣服已如何破敝和肮脏，除非我们已经这般地生活了，或经营了，或者说，已向着什么而航行了，在我们这古老的躯壳里已有着新的生机了，那时若还是依然故我，便有旧瓶装新酒之感了。我们的换羽毛的季节，就像飞禽的，必然是生命之中一个大的转折点。潜鸟退到僻静的池塘边去脱毛。蛇蜕皮的情形也是如此，同样的是蛹虫的茧。都是内心里孜孜扩展着的结果；衣服不过是我们的最表面的角质，或者说，尘世之烦恼而已。要不然我们将发现我们在伪装底下行进，到头来必不可兔地将披人类及我们自己的意见所唾弃。
