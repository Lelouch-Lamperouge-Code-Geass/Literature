he mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way. However, one’s eyes moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine high forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.

母亲脸上尚有往日的风韵，这风韵不久就会被颓丧的心情蚕食。她的神态令人愉悦地兼备了安详与明达事理，然而，人们的目光很快就会移向她的女儿，她那粉红色的手掌似乎有着魔力，她的双颊焕发出迷人的光彩，就像孩子们傍晚洗过冷水浴后红扑扑的小脸蛋一样可爱。她那漂亮而开阔的前额舒缓地上伸到发际，金黄色的头发像一枚盾牌将额头掩起，再蓬松出一头波浪形鬈发。她那对水汪汪的大眼睛晶莹亮丽，闪烁着光芒。她的双颊天然红润，那是从她有力跳动的年轻的心脏里迸发出的色彩。她的体态微妙地徘徊在孩提时代的最后边缘——她就要满十八岁了，她几乎完全长成妇人，然而少女时代的影子仍在她身上如清晨的露水般若隐若现。


He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

他回到他的房间去。尼科尔清楚，现在他处于一种最特别的心境之中，这是一种要把所有人都卷进来的兴奋，而随之而来的必然是他自己的忧郁，虽然他从未表现出来，但她认为他有这种忧郁。对某些事兴奋到这样一种程度，就与这些事本身的重要性不相称了，而结果是产生出一种真正异乎寻常的对人的喜好。除了很少一些硬心肠、疑心重的人，他具有让人迷恋、痴情的魅力。但他一旦意识到结交过程中的浪费和做作，便会产生这样的心理反应。他有时会满怀惊骇回顾他引发的情感的狂欢，就好像一位将军注视为满足他那野蛮的嗜血欲望而下令进行的一场大屠杀。

But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.

但是要被戴弗的世界接纳，哪怕只是一会儿，也是一种很特别的经历。人们相信：他为他们做了专门的安排，因为他能认识到他们性格的叮贵的独特性，而这种独特性多年来为生活中的妥协所淹没了。他对人体贴人微的关怀和优雅的风度很快能赢得人们的好感。他所表现出来的这种关怀和风度没有丝毫的犹豫和做作，因而只有凭借结果才能加以识别。另外，为了不使相互关系中的第一枝花朵枯萎，他毫无顾忌地敞开通向他那个诙谐有趣的世界的大门。只要他们心悦诚服地领受这一切，他们的快乐就是他首要考虑的事，但只要他们对它的丰富多彩闪出一丝怀疑来，他就会在他们的眼前消失，而他的言谈举止也就不会给人留下什么值得一提的印象了。

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother's mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.

　萝丝玛丽迷迷糊糊地睡了三个小时，然后静静地躺在床上，任思绪在月光中倘佯。夜色簇拥着她，情思撩人。她对前景很快丧失了信心，她想即便到最后极有可能会亲吻一下，但这个吻会和电影里的吻一样散淡。她在床上悠闲地翻了个身，这是她有生以来第一次失眠的征兆。她试着用她母亲考虑问题的思路去想。在这种情况下，她的敏锐常常超出了她的经历，对过去那些听来的只言片语也能回忆起来。
 
 
 Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.
 
 萝丝玛丽向来懒得动脑，除了对她母亲那种用之不竭的才情有过逻想，因而她母亲一旦将脐带最后剪断，她便睡不着觉了。一线黎明将天色送进高大的落地长窗，她从床上爬起来，赤裸着双脚走到外面尚有热气的平台上。夜空中传来神秘的声响。网球场那边的树上，一只坏脾气的鸟单调而得意洋洋地叫个不停。旅馆后边沿环形车道响起一阵脚步声，从不同的节奏听得出是走在泥土路上，碎石路上和水泥地上。随后又往回走，接着脚步声消失了。从墨一般的海上望过去，远处矗立着一座山的黑影。那儿住着戴弗夫妇。她想象他们俩在一起的情形，仿佛听到他们在轻轻地哼唱一支歌，这支歌犹如冉冉上升的烟云，犹如一支圣歌，回响在久远的年代和遥远的地方。他们的孩子睡着了，他们的大门在夜里关闭了。
