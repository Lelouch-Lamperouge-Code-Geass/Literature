The mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way. However, one’s eyes moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine high forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.

母亲脸上尚有往日的风韵，这风韵不久就会被颓丧的心情蚕食。她的神态令人愉悦地兼备了安详与明达事理，然而，人们的目光很快就会移向她的女儿，她那粉红色的手掌似乎有着魔力，她的双颊焕发出迷人的光彩，就像孩子们傍晚洗过冷水浴后红扑扑的小脸蛋一样可爱。她那漂亮而开阔的前额舒缓地上伸到发际，金黄色的头发像一枚盾牌将额头掩起，再蓬松出一头波浪形鬈发。她那对水汪汪的大眼睛晶莹亮丽，闪烁着光芒。她的双颊天然红润，那是从她有力跳动的年轻的心脏里迸发出的色彩。她的体态微妙地徘徊在孩提时代的最后边缘——她就要满十八岁了，她几乎完全长成妇人，然而少女时代的影子仍在她身上如清晨的露水般若隐若现。


He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

他回到他的房间去。尼科尔清楚，现在他处于一种最特别的心境之中，这是一种要把所有人都卷进来的兴奋，而随之而来的必然是他自己的忧郁，虽然他从未表现出来，但她认为他有这种忧郁。对某些事兴奋到这样一种程度，就与这些事本身的重要性不相称了，而结果是产生出一种真正异乎寻常的对人的喜好。除了很少一些硬心肠、疑心重的人，他具有让人迷恋、痴情的魅力。但他一旦意识到结交过程中的浪费和做作，便会产生这样的心理反应。他有时会满怀惊骇回顾他引发的情感的狂欢，就好像一位将军注视为满足他那野蛮的嗜血欲望而下令进行的一场大屠杀。

But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.

但是要被戴弗的世界接纳，哪怕只是一会儿，也是一种很特别的经历。人们相信：他为他们做了专门的安排，因为他能认识到他们性格的叮贵的独特性，而这种独特性多年来为生活中的妥协所淹没了。他对人体贴人微的关怀和优雅的风度很快能赢得人们的好感。他所表现出来的这种关怀和风度没有丝毫的犹豫和做作，因而只有凭借结果才能加以识别。另外，为了不使相互关系中的第一枝花朵枯萎，他毫无顾忌地敞开通向他那个诙谐有趣的世界的大门。只要他们心悦诚服地领受这一切，他们的快乐就是他首要考虑的事，但只要他们对它的丰富多彩闪出一丝怀疑来，他就会在他们的眼前消失，而他的言谈举止也就不会给人留下什么值得一提的印象了。

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother's mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.

　萝丝玛丽迷迷糊糊地睡了三个小时，然后静静地躺在床上，任思绪在月光中倘佯。夜色簇拥着她，情思撩人。她对前景很快丧失了信心，她想即便到最后极有可能会亲吻一下，但这个吻会和电影里的吻一样散淡。她在床上悠闲地翻了个身，这是她有生以来第一次失眠的征兆。她试着用她母亲考虑问题的思路去想。在这种情况下，她的敏锐常常超出了她的经历，对过去那些听来的只言片语也能回忆起来。
 
 
 Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.
 
 萝丝玛丽向来懒得动脑，除了对她母亲那种用之不竭的才情有过逻想，因而她母亲一旦将脐带最后剪断，她便睡不着觉了。一线黎明将天色送进高大的落地长窗，她从床上爬起来，赤裸着双脚走到外面尚有热气的平台上。夜空中传来神秘的声响。网球场那边的树上，一只坏脾气的鸟单调而得意洋洋地叫个不停。旅馆后边沿环形车道响起一阵脚步声，从不同的节奏听得出是走在泥土路上，碎石路上和水泥地上。随后又往回走，接着脚步声消失了。从墨一般的海上望过去，远处矗立着一座山的黑影。那儿住着戴弗夫妇。她想象他们俩在一起的情形，仿佛听到他们在轻轻地哼唱一支歌，这支歌犹如冉冉上升的烟云，犹如一支圣歌，回响在久远的年代和遥远的地方。他们的孩子睡着了，他们的大门在夜里关闭了。
 
Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as something cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole's "Oh, do I!" echoed in her mind. The particular mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.
 
萝丝玛丽大气不出地站在那儿，直到他们的声音渐渐远去。她起初甚至感到震惊，因为从他们相互之间的关系来看，她一直把他们当作那种没有肉体要求的人，当作那种感情冷漠的人。此刻，一股情感的激流流过她的全身，透心而朦胧。她不明白自己是欣羡还是反感，但唯一明白的是她自己被深深地打动了。遇到这种事，确实让人心动，尤其是尼科尔充满激情的话“哦，我爱你！”仍在她心头回响。她现在面临了她目睹的这幕情景的特殊氛围，但不管她与这种氛围的距离有多远，她自己的欲望告诉她，这是正常的——她并没有产生在出演某场爱情戏时常有的厌恶感。

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother's middle-class mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent money she had earned—she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.

尽管这件事与她无关，但她现在无可避免地参与进去了。当她同尼科尔一起去购物时，她甚至比尼科尔本人更在意这次幽会。她从新的角度来观察尼科尔，估量她的吸引力。当然，她是萝丝玛丽所见过的最有吸引力的女子——她庄重、虔诚、忠实，还有某种令人难以捉摸的东西，这一切萝丝玛丽运用她母亲的中产阶级的思想方式来加以考虑，并把它们同她对金钱的看法联系起来。萝丝玛丽的钱是她自己挣来的——她之所以能在欧洲漫游，因为她在一月的某一天跳入水池六次，那天她的体温从早晨的99度慢慢上升到103度①，这时她母亲出来阻止了她.

With Nicole’s help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds,miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermès— bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.

在尼科尔的指点下，萝丝玛丽用自己的钱买了两套衣服，两顶帽子和四双鞋子。尼科尔按照一份有两张纸的长长的清单采购物品，另外还买了陈列在橱窗里的东西。她买下喜欢的东西，未必都是她自己要用的，她买来是当作礼物送给朋友的。她买了一些彩色的珠子、几块海滩上用的折叠软垫、一些人造花、蜂蜜、一张专供客人用的床、几只包、几条围巾、几只鹦鹉、可摆在玩具房间中的袖珍物品及三码长的对虾色的某种新式布料。她还买了一打泳装、一条橡皮鳄鱼、一副黄金和象牙制成的旅行象棋、给艾贝的大号亚麻手帕、两件羚羊皮夹克，皮夹克的颜色是那种翠鸟灰，皮毛是大红的，这两件皮夹克是从赫尔墨斯商店买来的——她买下这些东西并不能与一个高级妓女的采购相提并论，后者购买内衣和珠宝，说到底是购买职业装备或者说买保险——而尼科尔的采购则是出于一种截然不同的考虑。尼科尔是才智和辛劳的产物。为了她，火车从芝加哥出发，穿过大陆丰腴的腹地，抵达加利福尼亚；胶姆糖工厂在冒烟，工厂的传送带连续运转着；男人们在缸里搅拌牙膏，从铜制的桶里汲取漱口剂；姑娘们在八月里麻利地装着番茄罐头，或在圣诞夜的杂货店里忙得七荤八素；印第安混血儿在巴西的咖啡种植园里辛勤劳作，幻想家不再享有新型拖拉机的专利权了——这只是向尼科尔进贡的一部分人，随着整个体制轰轰隆隆不可一世地向前推进，就给像尼科尔这样进行大量采购的行为推波助澜，那种买卖的亢奋不下于一个面对大火坚守岗位的消防队员的满脸红光。她体现了一些非常朴素的原则，这些原则掩盖了她本人的可悲命运。她对这些原则的体现是如此确切，以致这种买卖行为也显得优雅起来，而现在萝丝玛丽也竭力要加以仿效了。

"Good night, dear Dick." Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token … .

　“晚安，亲爱的迪克。”玛丽微笑着，好像她坐在这条空荡荡的船上会十分地快活。她是个勇敢的、有前途的女子，从某些方面来说她追随她的丈夫，改变自己来适应这种人或那种人，而并不能够让他偏离他的道路一步。有时她沮丧地意识到，她秘而不宣的自己的前程已深深地寄放在他的身上了，然而她身上有一股吉祥之气，仿佛她是一种象征…

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without question or regret.

昏暗的出租车里充溢着香水的芬芳，她用的正是她和尼科尔一起买的那种香水，她又挪近一些，身体依偎着他。他吻了她，但并不觉得欣喜。他知道这里面有一种激情，但她的眼睛和嘴唇没有丝毫这种激情的影子，她呼出的气息中有一股淡淡的香槟酒的味道。她紧紧地贴着他，他又吻她。他被她天真无邪的热吻镇住了。此时，他看了一眼窗外，那夜的黑暗，世界的黑暗让他心里生出一丝凉意。她还不明白，爱的辉煌属于心灵。有朝一日她明白了这一点，并融进宇宙的激情之中，那时，他可以无愧无悔地拥有她。

"Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let's drop it out of the picture." He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to sleep on. "So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That's an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?" She looked up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms and went on brushing… 

　“晚安，孩子。这真是太遗憾了。事情过去就别放心上了。”他说了这两句医院的口头禅，劝她去睡觉。“会有许多人爱上你的，当你完美无瑕地，包括感情上，迎来你的初恋，该有多好。那是一种旧观念，是吧？”在他向门口跨出一步时，她抬起头来看他。她看着他，丝毫不明白他到底有什么想法。她见他又慢慢地跨出一步，转身看了她一眼。她一时很想抓住他，吞掉他，想要他的嘴、他的耳朵、他的衣领，想要抱住他把他吞吃了。她看见他的手落在门的把手上。这时，她放弃了这个想法，一头倒在床上。当门关上后，她起身走到镜子那儿，开始梳理她的头发，一边微微地抽噎着。萝丝玛丽刷了一百五十下，像往常一样。接着又是一百五十下。她梳着梳着直到手臂发酸，然后又换只手继续流起来……
