The mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way. However, one’s eyes moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine high forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.

母亲脸上尚有往日的风韵，这风韵不久就会被颓丧的心情蚕食。她的神态令人愉悦地兼备了安详与明达事理，然而，人们的目光很快就会移向她的女儿，她那粉红色的手掌似乎有着魔力，她的双颊焕发出迷人的光彩，就像孩子们傍晚洗过冷水浴后红扑扑的小脸蛋一样可爱。她那漂亮而开阔的前额舒缓地上伸到发际，金黄色的头发像一枚盾牌将额头掩起，再蓬松出一头波浪形鬈发。她那对水汪汪的大眼睛晶莹亮丽，闪烁着光芒。她的双颊天然红润，那是从她有力跳动的年轻的心脏里迸发出的色彩。她的体态微妙地徘徊在孩提时代的最后边缘——她就要满十八岁了，她几乎完全长成妇人，然而少女时代的影子仍在她身上如清晨的露水般若隐若现。


He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

他回到他的房间去。尼科尔清楚，现在他处于一种最特别的心境之中，这是一种要把所有人都卷进来的兴奋，而随之而来的必然是他自己的忧郁，虽然他从未表现出来，但她认为他有这种忧郁。对某些事兴奋到这样一种程度，就与这些事本身的重要性不相称了，而结果是产生出一种真正异乎寻常的对人的喜好。除了很少一些硬心肠、疑心重的人，他具有让人迷恋、痴情的魅力。但他一旦意识到结交过程中的浪费和做作，便会产生这样的心理反应。他有时会满怀惊骇回顾他引发的情感的狂欢，就好像一位将军注视为满足他那野蛮的嗜血欲望而下令进行的一场大屠杀。

But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.

但是要被戴弗的世界接纳，哪怕只是一会儿，也是一种很特别的经历。人们相信：他为他们做了专门的安排，因为他能认识到他们性格的叮贵的独特性，而这种独特性多年来为生活中的妥协所淹没了。他对人体贴人微的关怀和优雅的风度很快能赢得人们的好感。他所表现出来的这种关怀和风度没有丝毫的犹豫和做作，因而只有凭借结果才能加以识别。另外，为了不使相互关系中的第一枝花朵枯萎，他毫无顾忌地敞开通向他那个诙谐有趣的世界的大门。只要他们心悦诚服地领受这一切，他们的快乐就是他首要考虑的事，但只要他们对它的丰富多彩闪出一丝怀疑来，他就会在他们的眼前消失，而他的言谈举止也就不会给人留下什么值得一提的印象了。

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother's mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.

　萝丝玛丽迷迷糊糊地睡了三个小时，然后静静地躺在床上，任思绪在月光中倘佯。夜色簇拥着她，情思撩人。她对前景很快丧失了信心，她想即便到最后极有可能会亲吻一下，但这个吻会和电影里的吻一样散淡。她在床上悠闲地翻了个身，这是她有生以来第一次失眠的征兆。她试着用她母亲考虑问题的思路去想。在这种情况下，她的敏锐常常超出了她的经历，对过去那些听来的只言片语也能回忆起来。
 
 
 Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.
 
 萝丝玛丽向来懒得动脑，除了对她母亲那种用之不竭的才情有过逻想，因而她母亲一旦将脐带最后剪断，她便睡不着觉了。一线黎明将天色送进高大的落地长窗，她从床上爬起来，赤裸着双脚走到外面尚有热气的平台上。夜空中传来神秘的声响。网球场那边的树上，一只坏脾气的鸟单调而得意洋洋地叫个不停。旅馆后边沿环形车道响起一阵脚步声，从不同的节奏听得出是走在泥土路上，碎石路上和水泥地上。随后又往回走，接着脚步声消失了。从墨一般的海上望过去，远处矗立着一座山的黑影。那儿住着戴弗夫妇。她想象他们俩在一起的情形，仿佛听到他们在轻轻地哼唱一支歌，这支歌犹如冉冉上升的烟云，犹如一支圣歌，回响在久远的年代和遥远的地方。他们的孩子睡着了，他们的大门在夜里关闭了。
 
Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as something cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole's "Oh, do I!" echoed in her mind. The particular mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.
 
萝丝玛丽大气不出地站在那儿，直到他们的声音渐渐远去。她起初甚至感到震惊，因为从他们相互之间的关系来看，她一直把他们当作那种没有肉体要求的人，当作那种感情冷漠的人。此刻，一股情感的激流流过她的全身，透心而朦胧。她不明白自己是欣羡还是反感，但唯一明白的是她自己被深深地打动了。遇到这种事，确实让人心动，尤其是尼科尔充满激情的话“哦，我爱你！”仍在她心头回响。她现在面临了她目睹的这幕情景的特殊氛围，但不管她与这种氛围的距离有多远，她自己的欲望告诉她，这是正常的——她并没有产生在出演某场爱情戏时常有的厌恶感。

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother's middle-class mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent money she had earned—she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.

尽管这件事与她无关，但她现在无可避免地参与进去了。当她同尼科尔一起去购物时，她甚至比尼科尔本人更在意这次幽会。她从新的角度来观察尼科尔，估量她的吸引力。当然，她是萝丝玛丽所见过的最有吸引力的女子——她庄重、虔诚、忠实，还有某种令人难以捉摸的东西，这一切萝丝玛丽运用她母亲的中产阶级的思想方式来加以考虑，并把它们同她对金钱的看法联系起来。萝丝玛丽的钱是她自己挣来的——她之所以能在欧洲漫游，因为她在一月的某一天跳入水池六次，那天她的体温从早晨的99度慢慢上升到103度①，这时她母亲出来阻止了她.

With Nicole’s help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds,miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermès— bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.

在尼科尔的指点下，萝丝玛丽用自己的钱买了两套衣服，两顶帽子和四双鞋子。尼科尔按照一份有两张纸的长长的清单采购物品，另外还买了陈列在橱窗里的东西。她买下喜欢的东西，未必都是她自己要用的，她买来是当作礼物送给朋友的。她买了一些彩色的珠子、几块海滩上用的折叠软垫、一些人造花、蜂蜜、一张专供客人用的床、几只包、几条围巾、几只鹦鹉、可摆在玩具房间中的袖珍物品及三码长的对虾色的某种新式布料。她还买了一打泳装、一条橡皮鳄鱼、一副黄金和象牙制成的旅行象棋、给艾贝的大号亚麻手帕、两件羚羊皮夹克，皮夹克的颜色是那种翠鸟灰，皮毛是大红的，这两件皮夹克是从赫尔墨斯商店买来的——她买下这些东西并不能与一个高级妓女的采购相提并论，后者购买内衣和珠宝，说到底是购买职业装备或者说买保险——而尼科尔的采购则是出于一种截然不同的考虑。尼科尔是才智和辛劳的产物。为了她，火车从芝加哥出发，穿过大陆丰腴的腹地，抵达加利福尼亚；胶姆糖工厂在冒烟，工厂的传送带连续运转着；男人们在缸里搅拌牙膏，从铜制的桶里汲取漱口剂；姑娘们在八月里麻利地装着番茄罐头，或在圣诞夜的杂货店里忙得七荤八素；印第安混血儿在巴西的咖啡种植园里辛勤劳作，幻想家不再享有新型拖拉机的专利权了——这只是向尼科尔进贡的一部分人，随着整个体制轰轰隆隆不可一世地向前推进，就给像尼科尔这样进行大量采购的行为推波助澜，那种买卖的亢奋不下于一个面对大火坚守岗位的消防队员的满脸红光。她体现了一些非常朴素的原则，这些原则掩盖了她本人的可悲命运。她对这些原则的体现是如此确切，以致这种买卖行为也显得优雅起来，而现在萝丝玛丽也竭力要加以仿效了。

"Good night, dear Dick." Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token … .

　“晚安，亲爱的迪克。”玛丽微笑着，好像她坐在这条空荡荡的船上会十分地快活。她是个勇敢的、有前途的女子，从某些方面来说她追随她的丈夫，改变自己来适应这种人或那种人，而并不能够让他偏离他的道路一步。有时她沮丧地意识到，她秘而不宣的自己的前程已深深地寄放在他的身上了，然而她身上有一股吉祥之气，仿佛她是一种象征…

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without question or regret.

昏暗的出租车里充溢着香水的芬芳，她用的正是她和尼科尔一起买的那种香水，她又挪近一些，身体依偎着他。他吻了她，但并不觉得欣喜。他知道这里面有一种激情，但她的眼睛和嘴唇没有丝毫这种激情的影子，她呼出的气息中有一股淡淡的香槟酒的味道。她紧紧地贴着他，他又吻她。他被她天真无邪的热吻镇住了。此时，他看了一眼窗外，那夜的黑暗，世界的黑暗让他心里生出一丝凉意。她还不明白，爱的辉煌属于心灵。有朝一日她明白了这一点，并融进宇宙的激情之中，那时，他可以无愧无悔地拥有她。

"Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let's drop it out of the picture." He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to sleep on. "So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That's an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?" She looked up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms and went on brushing… 

　“晚安，孩子。这真是太遗憾了。事情过去就别放心上了。”他说了这两句医院的口头禅，劝她去睡觉。“会有许多人爱上你的，当你完美无瑕地，包括感情上，迎来你的初恋，该有多好。那是一种旧观念，是吧？”在他向门口跨出一步时，她抬起头来看他。她看着他，丝毫不明白他到底有什么想法。她见他又慢慢地跨出一步，转身看了她一眼。她一时很想抓住他，吞掉他，想要他的嘴、他的耳朵、他的衣领，想要抱住他把他吞吃了。她看见他的手落在门的把手上。这时，她放弃了这个想法，一头倒在床上。当门关上后，她起身走到镜子那儿，开始梳理她的头发，一边微微地抽噎着。萝丝玛丽刷了一百五十下，像往常一样。接着又是一百五十下。她梳着梳着直到手臂发酸，然后又换只手继续流起来……


They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in the Rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens. They were lunching in the Norths' already dismantled apartment high above the green mass of leaves. The day seemed different to Rosemary from the day before—When she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed like birds' wings. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap of emotion being pumped through her body. A cool, clear confidence deepened and sang in her. She scarcely looked at Dick but she knew everything was all right.

　他们两分钟后要去会其他人，便在卢森堡公园对面的格尼麦大街下了车，萝丝玛丽使自己振作了起来。他们在诺思夫妇的高居于大片绿叶之上的已拆除设备的公寓里吃饭。这一天对萝丝玛丽来说似乎大不同于前一天——当她面对面地看到他时，他们的目光相遇，犹如鸟的翅膀一掠而过。这以后，一切都正常了，一切都美妙起来了。她知道他开始爱上她了。她感到无比的幸福，感到爱的暖流在全身涌动。一种沉稳、清晰的自信在增长，在心头欢乐地歌唱。她几乎不看迪克，但她知道一切都很顺利。

There she was—the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra figure; there she was—so young and innocent—the product of her mother's loving care; there she was—embodying all the immaturity of the race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty harlot's mind. She remembered how she had felt in that dress, especially fresh and new under the fresh young silk.

她出现在银幕上——那是一年前的她，一副学生模样。头发朝后流着，有关鬈曲着披散开来，就像一尊塔纳格拉陶俑①的硬挺挺的头发。瞧她——多么年轻，多么天真——这是她母亲精心呵护的结果；瞧她——带着少女全部的稚嫩，又在剪一个纸板洋娃娃，足以表现出纯朴少女之心。她还记得她当时穿着那套衣服时的感觉，尤其是穿着那套色彩鲜艳，新做的绸衣服，觉得神清气爽，兴致勃勃——

Daddy's girl. Was it a 'itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer? Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn't she dest too tweet? Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away. Women would forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within the picture one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film away from Rosemary. She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a bathroom. But Rosemary triumphed. Her fineness of character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a face that had not yet become mask-like—yet it was actually so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely: "I'm simply astounded. You're going to be one of the best actresses on the stage."

　老爸的女儿。它是一个小精灵吗？它吃过苦吗？噢——噢，甜蜜的，最甜蜜的小宝贝，她难道不甜蜜吗？在她的小拳头前，淫欲和腐化的力量消失得无影无踪，而且命运的进程停止了，不可避免的成了可避免的，三段论，辩证法，所有的合理性逃逸了。女人在家里忘掉那些脏餐具而哭泣起来，甚至在电影中一个女人哭个不停，差不多喧宾夺主地要把戏从萝丝玛丽那儿抢走了。在耗费大笔资金的一组戏里，她始终哭着。在邓肯-法伊夫餐厅，在机场，在只拍了两个镜头的快艇比赛中，在地铁，最后还在浴室里哭，但萝丝玛丽获胜了。她气质的优雅、她的勇气和镇定尽管会遭到世俗的侵蚀，然而萝丝玛丽用一张还未面具化的脸征服了观众——这部电影也确实感人，以致在放映中，坐在这排位子上的人接二连三地向她传递他们内心的激动。放映中曾有一次停顿，灯亮起来了，一阵掌声过后，迪克真诚地对她说：“我简直吃惊，你会成为银幕上最出色的演员。”
 
They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the mind.
 
他们最终四目相对，念咒语般地低声呼唤着对方的名字。他俩的名字在夜色中轻柔低回，比其他的字眼，其他的名目留存得更长久，比心中的乐曲更为舒缓。
 
Again the names—then they lurched together as if the taxi had swung them. Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was all new and warm, owned in common. They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other. They were both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. Nerves so raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast to breast… .
 
又念叨起对方的名字来——随后他们倒在一起，像是汽车颠了他们一下似的。她的胸脯紧贴着他，她的嘴唇是那么鲜嫩温馨，此刻它属于他们俩。他们感到一种几乎是痛苦的畅快，不再想什么，不再看什么。他们只是气息相通，身躯相拥。当全身的神经像钢琴的弦那样渐渐松弛下来，像柳条椅那样突然吱吱嘎嘎发出声响，他们俩都处在一种难以言说的、轻微的疲乏状态之中。此时他们的神经是如此敏感娇嫩，势必要得到对方的呼应，于是，嘴咬着嘴，胸贴着胸……
 
They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.
 
他们仍沉溺于爱的欢欣之中。他们都对对方抱着大胆的幻想，无数的幻想，因而这一个自我与那一个自我的沟通似乎是在一个同其他人类关系不相干的地方进行的。他们似乎不明不白地来到此地，仿佛是一系列纯粹偶然的事件驱使他们走到了一起，竟有这么多偶然事件，以致到最后他们不得不得出结论，他们都是为对方而来的。他们清清白白来到这儿，或者说看起来像是这样，事先并没有仅出于好奇或偷偷相会过。


Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the happiest. The first time was when she and Dick danced together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form as they floated, hovering like people in an amusing dream—he turned her here and there with such a delicacy of suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of precious cloth being displayed before fifty eyes. There was a moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging together. Some time in the early morning they were alone, and her damp powdery young body came up close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed there, crushed against a background of other people's hats and wraps… 

日后她回忆起她感到的那些最幸福的时刻。第一次是她和迪克一起跳舞。他高大健壮，她则妩媚，光彩照人。他们翩翩起舞，犹如在甜蜜的梦幻中倘佯——他带着她满场子转，巧妙地向人暗示，她就像一束艳丽的鲜花，一块华贵的布料展现在那二十五个人眼前。有一刻，他们似乎停下来不再跳舞，只是紧紧地偎依在一起。清晨的某个时辰，他们单独呆着，她汗津津的搽过粉的娇躯紧贴着他，他的衣服被揉得皱巴巴的，他们在挂着别人的帽子和外套的地方拥抱…

They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by Abe's gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness. All of them were conscious of the solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed. But they were frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.

　这一群人站在那儿，由于艾贝高大的身躯而显得有些不协调。他背对着她们，活像一艘古代大帆船的残骸。他倚仗这高大的身躯来制约他的软弱，他的自我放纵，他的褊狭和他的痛苦。她们都能感受到从他身上透露出来的那种高贵的气质，都清楚他取得的成就，他的成就是断断续续的，有启发性的，当然已被人超越了，但是，她们担惊受怕的还是他尚存的那种意愿，过去这是一种去活的意愿，而如今变成了一种去死的意愿。
 
He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his life—it was out of line with everything that had preceded it—even out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon Rosemary. Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness—his presence walking around this block was an intrusion. But Dick's necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirt-sleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirt-sleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small briefcase like a dandy—just as another man once found it necessary to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes. Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven, unexpurgated.
 
他知道他眼下所做的将是他生活中一个转折点——它不同于先前所做的一切，甚至也不同于他希望在萝丝玛丽身上产生的结果。萝丝玛丽总是把他视作正确的榜样——他此刻在这段地区走来走去简直是一种侵犯，但迪克这一行为的必要性，是某种内部现实的反映：他是情不自禁地去那儿，或站在那儿的——他的衬衫袖口正好垂到手腕，他外衣的袖口像阀门似的正好包住衬衫袖口，衣服的衣领贴着他的脖颈；他的头发修剪整齐，他手拎着小巧的公文包，俨然一个花花公子——就像是另一个人觉得有必要站在费拉拉①的教堂前，悲痛地仟悔。或许迪克正在对尚未忘怀、尚未忏悔、尚未处理的事情祷告吧——

After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact. It was just the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. So rigidly did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity—we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.

他在那儿逗留了三刻钟，之后他突然与别人有了接触，这正是那种对他来说极有可能发生的事，尤其当他处于不想见任何人的心境。他有时固执地保护着他易受伤害的自我意识，以致他常常挫败自己的意图。这就像一个演技拙劣的演员，故意弄出一个悬念，以刺激观众的情感，吸引他们的注意，以便使他人产生一种能力来填补他留下的空白。同样，我们很少对需要和乞求我们怜悯的人表示同情——我们将同情保留给那些人，他们以不同的方式让我们体验到怜悯的抽象功能。

Back at two o'clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of Nicole had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of Leonardo's girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator. Dick moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.

　回想下午两点时，在乔治王旅馆的阳台上，尼科尔的美丽辉映着萝丝玛丽的美丽，犹如达-芬奇的蒙娜丽莎对应插图画家笔下的美人。迪克在雨中前行，心神狂乱，惊惧不定，他内心翻腾着许多男子的激情，他明白事情不会简单。
 
Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of. She was now what is sometimes called a "little wild thing"—by twenty-four full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle—counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.

萝丝玛丽怀着一种无人知晓的柔情打开了房门。她现在成了人们有时所说的一个“狂热的小东西”——已经有二十四小时了，她还有点魂不守舍。她全力应付周边的混乱，仿佛她的命运就是一副拼图玩具——清点收益，清点希望，指派迪克和尼科尔、她母亲，还有她昨天认识的那个导游，就像是立足于命运的丝线上。

When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.

当迪克敲门时，她刚穿戴整齐，一边注视着窗外的雨，一边想起一首小诗和贝弗利希尔斯①积满雨水的水沟。她打开门，看见他像往常一样。在她眼里，他始终如一，像一尊天神，这就如同在年轻人看来，一个老年人永远是刻板僵化的。迪克见到她则产生了一种难以抑制的失望。他没有马上对她的坦然和甜甜的微笑做出反应，她身体极为匀称，此时就像一个花蕾，日后必定绽放出一朵花花来。他注意到通向浴室的地毯上有她湿湿的一溜脚印——

"Miss Television," he said with a lightness he did not feel. He put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his stick against the wall. His chin dominated the lines of pain around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.

"Come and sit on my lap close to me," he said softly, "and let me see about your lovely mouth."
She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down outside—drip—dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold image she had created.

Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty gives back the images of one's best thoughts he thought of his responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her being two doors down across the corridor.

"电视小姐。”他故作轻松地打趣道。他把他的手套、公文包放在梳妆台上，手杖靠在墙边。他的下巴控制着他嘴角的痛苦的线条，使它们像个宜表露露的恐惧一样爬上他的额头和眼角。

“过来，坐在我的腿上，”他温柔地说，“让我看看你可爱的小嘴。”

她走过来，坐在他的腿上，此时窗外的雨水渐渐慢下来了——滴答——滴答，她将嘴唇贴在她勾画出来的美丽而又冷漠的形象上。

此时。她在他嘴上吻了几下，她凑向他时，他觉得她的脸那么丰润，他从未见过有什么东西她凝脂般的肌肤那样令人目眩。有时候，美丽使人产生最高尚的思想，他这时就想起了对尼科尔的责任，想起她就可能性在走廊对面隔着两个房门的房间里。

The veranda of the central building was illuminated from open French windows, save where the black shadows of stripling walls and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs slithered down into a gladiola bed. From the figures that shuffled between the rooms Miss Warren emerged first in glimpses and then sharply when she saw him; as she crossed the threshold her face caught the room's last light and brought it outside with her. She walked to a rhythm--all that week there had been singing in her ears, summer songs of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the singing had become so loud she could have joined in with it.

从敞开着的落地长窗透出的灯光照亮了中心大楼的走廊，只有一条条墙的暗影和铁制椅子的古怪影子叠合着投到菖蒲属植物的花坛上。从那些在房间之间拖着步子行走的人当中，出现了沃伦小姐的身影，先还模模糊糊，随后她看见了迪克，她的身影也十分清晰了。她跨过门槛时，她的脸被房间里射出的光线照亮了。她随身把光线也带到了室外。她走路很有节奏——一个星期来，她耳朵里老是响着歌声，那有着炽热的天空和浓密的树阴的夏日的歌。当他到来时，这歌声是如此的嘹亮，她可以应和着唱出来了。

Within the building a trio broke into Suppe's "Light Cavalry." Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.

　大楼里响起了苏佩①的三重奏《轻骑兵》。尼科尔乘机站起身来，她年轻美丽的身体给迪克留下越来越强烈的印象。他顿时心潮澎湃。她微笑起来，这是一种动人的孩子般的笑，就像世界上所有那些失落了的青春一般可爱—
 
 Her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled Dick--whenever he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up like an angel's when they came into the range of a roadside arc. She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his relation to her, her confidence increased--there was that excitement about her that seemed to reflect all the excitement of the world.

"I'm not under any restraint at all," she said. "I'll play you two good tunes called 'Wait Till the Cows Come Home' and 'Good-by, Alexander.'"

He was late the next time, a week later, and Nicole was waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass walking from Franz's house. Her hair drawn back of her ears brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come. They went to the cache where she had left the phonograph, turned a corner by the workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a low wall, facing miles and miles of rolling night.

　他们一路散着步，她那套奶色衣服一会现出蓝色，一会又成了灰色。她的一头金发颇使迪克眼花——每当他转过脸来，她总是嫣然一笑。他们走进路边一座拱形凉亭时，她容光焕发，犹如一位天使。她感谢他为她做的一切，就好像是他带她参加了一个晚会。当迪克对他们之间的关系越来越感到没有把握的时候，她的信心却在增长——她神采飞扬，似乎整个世界也骚动兴奋起来。

　　“我不用受什么约束了，”她说，“我给你放两支好歌，叫做《等到牛群回家》和《再见，亚历山大》。”

　　一星期后，第二次约会他去晚了，尼科尔在他从弗朗茨家里出来经过的路上等他。她的头发拢在耳后，披在肩上，这式样使她的脸显得像是刚从秀发中钻出来一样，就如同此时此刻，她从树林中走出来到皎洁的月光之下。一个无人知晓的东西造就了她。迪克希望她没有背景，她只是一个不知如何回家的迷途姑娘，有的只是她身后的那片黑暗。他们朝她藏唱片的地方走去，在工作间附近拐个弯，爬上一块岩石，在一堵矮墙后边坐了下来，面对着茫茫夜色。
  
He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant, so that the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back to herself. He delighted in her stretching out her hands to new octaves now that she found herself beautiful and rich. He tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her together--glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.

　他比她年长许多，能够欣赏她那种少女的虚荣和乐趣，欣赏她离开餐馆时在门厅的的镜子前驻足顾盼的模样，觉得这种清纯多变的习性能够让她回复她的本来面貌。眼下她知道自己既美丽又富有，因而手舞足蹈起来，迪克也为此感到高兴。他真诚地想要她摆脱任何这种想法，即他挽救了她——乐于看到她无需依赖他而获得幸福和自信。问题在于，尼科尔最终将一切当作祭神用的供品和爱神的木堆放在他跟前。
 
 Her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove through the rain, had a promise Dick had never seen before: the high cheek-bones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather than feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising colt--a creature whose life did not promise to be only a projection of youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a true growing; the face would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and the economy were there.
 
 在穿过蒙蒙细雨的淡淡的夕阳的映照下。她象牙般白皙的面颊上镀上一层金色，洋溢着一种迪克以前从未见过的希望之光。她高高的颧骨，略显苍白的脸色，沉静而非狂热的神情，这些都让人想起一个充满希望的新手的轮廓——这样一个尤物，其生命所展示的不只是灰色屏幕上的青存的投影，而是一种真正的成长。即使人到中年这张脸还是美丽的，即使垂垂老矣这张脸也不会丑陋，因为有基本的脸架子和匀称的五官在那儿。
 
 The delight in Nicole's face--to be a feather again instead of a plummet, to float and not to drag. She was a carnival to watch--at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and gesturing--sometimes the shadow fell and the dignity of old suffering flowed down into her finger tips. Dick wished himself away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world well left behind. He resolved to go to the other hotel.
 
 尼科尔一脸欢欣——成为一片羽毛而不是一只铅锤，往下飘而不是往下坠。她犹如一台让人观赏的狂欢演出，时而拘泥腼腆，装模作样；时而又挤眉弄眼，手舞足蹈——有时，阴影降临，往日受难的高贵气血。直流注到她的指尖。迪克希望自己远远离开她，担心他会让人想起那个抛在身后的世界。他打定主意住另一家旅馆。
 
 The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.

"My God," he gasped, "you're fun to kiss."

That was talk, but Nicole had a better hold on him now and she held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving him as suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon. She felt: There, that'll show him, how conceited; how he could do with me; oh, wasn't it wonderful! I've got him, he's mine. Now in the sequence came flight, but it was all so sweet and new that she dawdled, wanting to draw all of it in.

She shivered suddenly. Two thousand feet below she saw the necklace and bracelet of lights that were Montreux and Vevey, beyond them a dim pendant of Lausanne. From down there somewhere ascended a faint sound of dance music. Nicole was up in her head now, cool as cool, trying to collate the sentimentalities of her childhood, as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. But she was still afraid of Dick, who stood near her, leaning, characteristically, against the iron fence that rimmed the horseshoe; and this prompted her to say: "I can remember how I stood waiting for you in the garden--holding all my self in my arms like a basket of flowers. It was that to me anyhow--I thought I was sweet--waiting to hand that basket to you."

He breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big every time she came close, her hands holding him by the shoulders.

"It's raining hard."

Suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes across the lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing clouds in order to break them. The lights of the promenade went off, went on again. Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared--the hotel crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.

她凑上来时，说话声变低了，仿佛沉人她的胸怀，绷紧了她胸口的紧身胸衣。他感到了她娇嫩的嘴唇，她的身体如释重负地靠着他越来越有力地搂住她的手臂。即使迪克配制出某种不可溶解的混合剂，也莫过于眼前这情形了，就像是原子结合在一起，难解难分。你可以将它们统统扔掉，但休想让它们再回复到原子状态。他抱住她，感受着她青春的美好。她越来越紧地依偎着他，她自己的嘴唇也给她带来前所未有的新感觉，她沉浸、淹没在爱的激情之中，然而又显得志得意满。他则为能遭遇这样一种激情而感到庆幸，虽然这只是从她湿润的眼中反映出来的。

　　“天哪，”他喘口气说，“跟你亲吻真是美妙。”

　　这还中听，但尼科尔此时占了他的上风，她抓住这个机会。她卖弄风情似的转身走开，就像今天下午在缆车站一样，撇下他一脸茫然。她感到，这样就可以向他表明，他多么自负，他如何能配得上我。哦，这难道不是很美妙吗？我得到了他，他是我的。此时，她自然是飘飘然了，但这一切是多么地甜蜜和新鲜，她不禁要流连再三，恨不得全部纳入胸怀。

　　她猛地打了个冷战。她眺望着两千英尺远的山下灯火闪烁，犹如发光的项链和手镯的，那是蒙特勒和沃韦市。在它们后面，朦胧的是像挂件似的洛桑市。山下隐约传来舞会的音乐声。尼科尔打定主意，冷静下来，想要审视一下童年时的多愁善感，显得像一个打完架的人喝得酩酊大醉那样潇潇洒洒，但她仍然惧怕迪克，他就站在她身边，以一种独特的方式倚在马蹄形小径围起来的铁栏杆上。她见此情景便说，“我能记得我当时是怎样站在花园里等候你的——我的整个生命，如同一篮鲜花，被我捧在怀里。不管怎样，我那时就是这样的心情——我觉得，我一片真情——等着把花篮献给你。”

　　他吻着她的肩膀，执拗地要她转过身来。她一连吻了他几次，每当她凑上来，她的脸就越加丰腴起来，她搂着他的双肩。

　　“雨下大了。”

　　突然，湖对面暗红色的山坡上传来一声轰响，人们正在向酝酿冰雹的云层开炮，以便驱散它们。他们散步的地方的灯灭了一下，又亮了起来。这时，暴风雨急速地卷了过来，先是从天上倾泻而下，随后挨着山洪奔腾而来，淹没了道路，灌满了石砌的沟渠。天空一片漆黑、异常恐怖，丝状闪电划破夜空，隆隆雷声震天动地。形态狰狞的乱云掠过旅馆。山峰和湖泊都湮没了——旅馆蜷缩在喧闹、混乱和黑暗之中。
  
Baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in being almost thirty. Symptomatically she had pulled two men with her from London, one scarcely down from Cambridge, one old and hard with Victorian lecheries. Baby had certain spinsters' characteristics—she was alien from touch, she started if she was touched suddenly, and such lingering touches as kisses and embraces slipped directly through the flesh into the forefront of her consciousness. She made few gestures with her trunk, her body proper—instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in almost an old-fashioned way. She relished the foretaste of death, prefigured by the catastrophes of friends—persistently she clung to the idea of Nicole's tragic destiny.

巴比是个身材修长，面容姣好的女子，有着快到三十岁年龄的种种气象。她显然从伦敦拉了两个男子跟着她，一个刚从剑桥来，一个则是有维多利亚遗风的老古板。巴比有老处女的一些特性——她不习惯被人触摸，要是有人突然碰了她一下，她会惊跳起来，像接吻和拥抱这类缠绵的接触，会通过皮肉直接传导到她的意识的表层，她很少用她的身体做出合适的姿态——相反，她几乎用一种老派的方式跺脚和晃头。她津津乐道朋友们因不幸而预尝到死亡的滋味——她坚持认为尼科尔的悲剧是她的命。

He was forty. Upon his healthy maturity reposed a set of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the broken rich whom he re-educated. His scientific heredity might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. At the hotel Baby Warren made a quick examination of him, and failing to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized one another, treated him thereafter with her second manner. Nicole was always a little afraid of him. Dick liked him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.

他四十岁，有健康成熟的外表，也有一套讨人喜欢的体面的处世方式，然而，他最感到自在的还是某种平稳的安定状态，在这种状态下，他可以鄙视那些他给予再教育的精神崩溃的富人。他的科学禀赋也许可以给他拓展更宽广的世界，但他似乎有意选择下层社会作为立足点，他择偶的行为就表明了这种选择。在旅馆，巴比-沃伦将他草草地审视了一番，没有发现任何值得敬重的特征，也没有找到特权阶层彼此认可的那种更为雅致的美德或谦恭有礼的举止，因而，她把他当作二等人物来对待。尼科尔总有点怕他。迪克喜欢他，就像喜欢朋友一样，对他毫无保留。

As he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house and the night as empty. In the next room Nicole muttered something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness she was feeling in her sleep. For him time stood still and then every few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick re-wind of a film, but for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty.

他坐在床边，觉得这房间，整幢房子，连同黑夜是一片虚空。隔壁房间，尼科尔发出一阵凄凉的嘟哝声。他为她睡梦中感受到的孤苦无助而难过。他觉得时间停滞了，接着每过几年，时间又冲刺般地加速起来，犹如电影的快速倒片一般。而对尼科尔来说，岁月是通过钟表、日历和生日消逝的，而与日俱增的是对美貌已去的哀伤。

Even this past year and a half on the Zugersee seemed wasted time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen on the road turning pink in May, brown in July, black in September, white again in Spring. She had come out of her first illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much, yet deprived of any subsistence except Dick, bringing up children she could only pretend gently to love, guided orphans. The people she liked, rebels mostly, disturbed her and were bad for her—she sought in them the vitality that had made them independent or creative or rugged, sought in vain—for their secrets were buried deep in childhood struggles they had forgotten. They were more interested in Nicole's exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her illness. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be owned.

Many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his hold on her. They had many fine times together, fine talks between the loves of the white nights, but always when he turned away from her into himself he left her holding Nothing in her hands and staring at it, calling it many names, but knowing it was only the hope that he would come back soon.

即使对在楚格湖的这一年半的生活，她也觉得是虚度时光，只有走在路上的工人的衣着才稍许表现出季节的变换：他们五月穿粉红色衣服，七月是棕色，九月黑色，春天时又穿上白色衣服。她怀着新的希望，挺过了第一次的发病，心中有着许多的期盼，然而除了迪克，任何维系生存的东西都被剥夺了。抚养孩子，她也只是装出疼爱的样子，只当他们是被指导的孤儿。她喜欢的人，多半是一些放荡不羁的人，他们打扰她的生活，对她并无好处——她在他们身上寻找那曾使他们具有独立精神或创造才能或坚强意志的生命活力，但这种寻找是徒劳的——因为他们的秘密已深埋在他们已经忘却的童年时的斗争中了。他们对尼科尔的外表的和谐和风度更感兴趣，这恰恰是她病情的一个方面。尽管她拥有着不愿被别人拥有的迪克，但她仍过着孤寂的生活。

他有几次想放手不去管她，但都没有成功。他们在一起度过了许多美好时光，曾有多少个不眠之夜娓娓长谈，但每次他转身离她而去，留给她的只是手中的虚幻，可以凝视它，呼唤它，但她知道，这只是一种希望，希望他很快就回来。

"That's all." With disgust he heard himself lying, but here and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed into a lie. "Outside of that there's only confusion and chaos. I won't lecture to you—we have too acute a realization of your physical suffering. But it's only by meeting the problems of every day, no matter how trifling and boring they seem, that you can make things drop back into place again. After that—perhaps you'll be able again to examine—"

He had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his thought: "—the frontiers of consciousness." The frontiers that artists must explore were not for her, ever. She was fine-spun, inbred—eventually she might find rest in some quiet mysticism. Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.

—Not for you, he almost said. It's too tough a game for you.

Yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her unreservedly, almost sexually. He wanted to gather her up in his arms, as he so often had Nicole, and cherish even her mistakes, so deeply were they part of her. The orange light through the drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on the bed, the spot of face, the voice searching the vacuity of her illness and finding only remote abstractions.

“就这些。”他讨厌自己说谎，但此时此刻，这话题纵使能说上千言万语也只能压缩成一句谎话。“除此以外，只有糊涂和混乱。我不想教训你——我们非常清楚你身体受的痛苦，但只有面对每天会有的问题，不论这些问题多么琐碎和乏味，你才能重新回到原来的状态。此后——也许你就能再次审视——”

他慢慢地说，以免把话一下子说完，“——意识的边缘。”艺术家必须探索的意识边缘从来与她无缘。她过于琐碎，心胸狭窄——她最终可能会在某种宁静的神秘主义那里找到归宿。探索精神适合那些具有庄稼汉的血气的，五大三粗的人，他们可以像吃面包和盐那样承受每一寸肌肤和精神上的刑罚——
  
这不适合你，他几乎要说出口来。这玩艺对你来说太艰难了。

但在她那种令人敬畏的深厚的痛苦面前，他又对她满怀同情，几乎是一种怜爱之情。他想把她搂在怀里，就像他常常搂住尼科尔一样，他甚至欣赏她的缺陷，因为这缺陷是深藏于她体内的一部分。橙黄色的光线透过窗帘，照到床上她那犹如石棺般的躯体，她的脸庞，她的声音好像在探究她疾病背后的那片虚空，所得到的只是一片虚无缥缈的思绪。
 
A wave of agony went over him. It was awful that such a fine tower should not be erected, only suspended, suspended from him. Up to a point that was right: men were for that, beam and idea, girder and logarithm; but somehow Dick and Nicole had become one and equal, not opposite and complementary; she was Dick too, the drought in the marrow of his bones. He could not watch her disintegrations without participating in them. His intuition rilled out of him as tenderness and compassion—he could only take the characteristically modern course, to interpose—he would get a nurse from Zurich, to take her over to-night.

他感到一阵揪心的痛楚，这多可怕。一个如此娇美的身躯竟然站立不住，只能吊着，吊在他身上。在一定程度上这又是对的，男人就得这样：挑大梁、拿主意、当家理财。然而在某种意义上，迪克和尼科尔已成为一体的、平等的，既不是对立的，又不是互补的。她就是迪克，是他骨子里的伤痛，他不可能旁观她精神崩溃而无动于衷，他天生的温情和怜悯从心底汩汩流出——他只能采取具有现代特征的步骤：干预疗法——他打算从苏黎世雇一个护士，今晚就照料她。

Dick tried to rest—the struggle would come presently at home and he might have to sit a long time, restating the universe for her. A "schizophrêne" is well named as a split personality—Nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing need be explained and one to whom nothing could be explained. It was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it. He felt it necessary that this time Nicole cure herself; he wanted to wait until she remembered the other times, and revolted from them. In a tired way, he planned that they would again resume the régime relaxed a year before.

迪克想要歇一会——他知道一回家就会有争执，他也许要花费很多时间，把事情整个儿向她细细解释。一个“精神分裂症患者”有理由被称为人格分裂者——尼科尔是这样一个人，要么无需解释，要么无法解释，所以需要以一种积极和肯定的持之以恒的方式对待她，对她现实的道路永远敞开，使逃避之路难以通行。然而伴随着疯狂而出现的才思敏捷，多才多艺就如同丰沛的雨水渗进、漫过和冲刷着堤坝。这需要许多人的齐心协力的配合。他觉得这一次尼科尔需要自我治疗。他准备等待，直到她回忆起先前的经历并感到厌恶。他煞费苦心地筹划，想重新采用一年前放松下来的饮食节制疗法。

Now she lowered the lights for love. Why else should she want to shut off his view of her? He sent his words to her like letters, as though they left him some time before they reached her.

"Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you." Then they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. She pressed against him, and went back to her chair.

It could not go on being merely pleasant in the room. Forward or backward; when the phone rang once more he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed, opening Albert McKisco's novel. Presently Rosemary came in and sat beside him.
"You have the longest eyelashes," she remarked.
"We are now back at the Junior Prom. Among those present are Miss Rosemary Hoyt, the eyelash fancier—"

She kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless. Her breathing was young and eager and exciting. Her lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.
When they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she whispered, "No, not now—those things are rhythmic."

Disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his mind, but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was poised half a foot above him, he said lightly:
"Darling—that doesn't matter."
Her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was the eternal moonlight in it.
"That would be poetic justice if it should be you," she said. She twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and boxed her disarranged hair with her hands. Presently she drew a chair close to the bed and stroked his cheek.

她把灯光调暗些，以便于谈情说爱。她为什么不让他好好看看她呢？他说起话来就像是把一个个字母送她耳朵里，好像这些宇母要花些时间才能到达她那儿。

　　“坐在这儿，又靠得这么近，真想吻吻你。”接着他们站在房间中央热烈地亲吻起来。她紧挨着他回到自己的椅子上。

　　仅仅在客厅里亲热是不够的。要么前进，要么后退。当电话又一次响起时，他踅进了卧室，躺倒在她的床上，打开艾伯特-麦基斯克的小说。萝丝玛丽走进来，坐在他的身边。

　　“你的睫毛真长。”她说。

　　“我们现在是在大学三年级生举办的舞会上，出席舞会的是萝丝玛丽-霍伊特小姐，她是个眼睫毛迷——”

　　她吻了他，他把她拉下来，他们躺在一起，又亲吻起来。她的呼吸透出青春气息，显得急迫和兴奋。她的嘴唇有些粗糙，但口角柔软。

　　他们仍和衣搂抱着。他手脚忙乱，她气喘吁吁，胸脯起伏，低声说，“不，现在不行——那些事要慢慢来。”

　　他克制着把自己的激情压到大脑的角落里去。他用手臂托起她绵软的身体，一直把她举到离他半英尺高，他轻轻地说：

　　“亲爱的——这没关系。”

　　他仰面看着她，她的脸犹如一轮变幻着的月亮，发出永恒的光辉。

　　“要是你这么做，你会得到善果的。”她说。她从他怀里挣脱出来，走到镜子那儿，用手拍打着凌乱的头发。过后，拖过一把椅子放到床边，她轻轻地抚摸着他的面颊。


Rosemary insisted on treating Dick to lunch next day. They went to a little trattoria kept by an Italian who had worked in America, and ate ham and eggs and waffles. Afterward, they went to the hotel. Dick's discovery that he was not in love with her, nor she with him, had added to rather than diminished his passion for her. Now that he knew he would not enter further into her life, she became the strange woman for him. He supposed many men meant no more than that when they said they were in love—not a wild submergence of soul, a dipping of all colors into an obscuring dye, such as his love for Nicole had been. Certain thoughts about Nicole, that she should die, sink into mental darkness, love another man, made him physically sick.

次日，萝丝玛丽坚持要请迪克吃饭。他们来到一个在美国干过活的意大利人开的餐馆，吃了火腿蛋和华夫饼。餐后，他们回到旅馆。迪克发觉他未曾爱上她，她也并不爱他，但这一发现并未削弱，反而增强了他对她的情欲。既然他明白他不会更深入到她的生活中去，她对他而言变成了一个陌生的女人。他猜想许多人说自己陷入爱河时，所表达的也不过如此——不会是灵魂的沉沦，也不是将所有的色彩浸入到一只染缸中去，就像他对尼科尔的爱那样。他想起了尼科尔，尼科尔应该去死的想法沉入到精神的黑暗中去了，而想到她可能爱上另一个男人，他感到内心阵阵痛楚。
 
Dick's interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven and nine. He managed to reach them over the heads of employees on the principle that both the forcing of children and the fear of forcing them were inadequate substitutes for the long, careful watchfulness, the checking and balancing and reckoning of accounts, to the end that there should be no slip below a certain level of duty. He came to know them much better than Nicole did, and in expansive moods over the wines of several countries he talked and played with them at length. They had that wistful charm, almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned early not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of old families of the Western world, brought up rather than brought out. Dick thought, for example, that nothing was more conducive to the development of observation than compulsory silence.

迪克对孩子的兴趣随他们年龄的增长而增长，眼下他们一个十一岁，一个九岁。他设法采用不同于保姆或家庭教师的方式来和他们相处，他的原则是：苛责和放任都无法代替对他们长期的、细心的观察，无法代替对他们言行的考察、评估和判断，这样才不至于疏忽他们相应承担的责仟。他比尼科尔更了解他们。几杯各国的名酒下肚之后，他便兴致勃勃地同孩子们海阔天空地聊天，尽情地玩乐。他们很安静，甚至有一种忧伤的神情，这是那些很早就懂得不能放声大哭或咧嘴大笑的孩子的特点。他们早就不会流露偏激的情绪，而满足于生活的常规和可以得到的朴素的乐趣。这种平静的生活在西方世界那些古老家族的经历中。被认为是一种可取的生活方式，这恰恰是教养的标志，而不是一时的表现。譬如，迪克就认为，对观察力的发展来说，最有效的莫过于克制性的沉默。

Nicole went on through her garden routine. She left the flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the house later by the gardener. Reaching the sea wall she fell into a communicative mood and no one to communicate with; so she stopped and deliberated. She was somewhat shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but other women have lovers—why not me? In the fine spring morning the inhibitions of the male world disappeared and she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind blew her hair until her head moved with it. Other women have had lovers—the same forces that last night had made her yield to Dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding to the wind, content and happy with the logic of, Why shouldn't I?

She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. But from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she had fished out something tangible to lay beside the rest of her loot. If she need not, in her spirit, be forever one with Dick as he had appeared last night, she must be something in addition, not just an image on his mind, condemned to endless parades around the circumference of a medal.

尼科尔在花园里继续做那些照例要做的事情。她将剪下的鲜花放在指定的地方，好让花工稍后拿到屋子里去。她来到海堤，这时她很想找个人说说话，但此处找不到这样一个人。她于是停住脚想起心事来。她有些吃惊，竟然对另一个男人发生了兴趣，但别的女人有情人呀——为什么我不能有呢？在这个清新的春天早晨，有关男人世界的禁忌消失了，在思维的园地，她的心像花儿一样欢乐地开放。风儿吹拂着她的头发，她随风儿晃动着脑袋——别的女人也有情人——正是昨晚使她产生迪克死去的心理的那股力量，此刻又让她陶醉在春风之中，并对那种逻辑感到满意和欣喜，为什么我不能有情人呢？

　　她坐在低矮的海堤上，眺望着大海，但从另一片大海，那波涛汹涌的幻想之海，她钓起了某个实在的东西，放在了她的其他战利品的边上。如果在精神上，她不必始终如一地面对迪克，就像昨晚那样，那她也必然有些额外的东西，不只是他心目中的那个形象，注定要围绕一枚奖章而无休止地旋转。
