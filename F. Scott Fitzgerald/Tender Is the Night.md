On the pleasant shore of the French Riviera, about half way between Marseilles and the Italian border, stands a large, proud, rose-colored hotel. Deferential palms cool its flushed façade, and before it stretches a short dazzling beach. Lately it has become a summer resort of notable and fashionable people; a decade ago it was almost deserted after its English clientele went north in April. Now, many bungalows cluster near it, but when this story begins only the cupolas of a dozen old villas rotted like water lilies among the massed pines between Gausse’s Hôtel des Étrangers and Cannes, five miles away.

The hotel and its bright tan prayer rug of a beach were one. In the early morning the distant image of Cannes, the pink and cream of old fortifications, the purple Alp that bounded Italy, were cast across the water and lay quavering in the ripples and rings sent up by sea-plants through the clear shallows. Before eight a man came down to the beach in a blue bathrobe and with much preliminary application to his person of the chilly water, and much grunting and loud breathing, floundered a minute in the sea. When he had gone, beach and bay were quiet for an hour. Merchantmen crawled westward on the horizon; bus boys shouted in the hotel court; the dew dried upon the pines. In another hour the horns of motors began to blow down from the winding road along the low range of the Maures, which separates the littoral from true Provençal France.

A mile from the sea, where pines give way to dusty poplars, is an isolated railroad stop, whence one June morning in 1925 a victoria brought a woman and her daughter down to Gausse’s Hôtel. The mother’s face was of a fading prettiness that would soon be patted with broken veins; her expression was both tranquil and aware in a pleasant way. However, one’s eyes moved on quickly to her daughter, who had magic in her pink palms and her cheeks lit to a lovely flame, like the thrilling flush of children after their cold baths in the evening. Her fine high forehead sloped gently up to where her hair, bordering it like an armorial shield, burst into lovelocks and waves and curlicues of ash blonde and gold. Her eyes were bright, big, clear, wet, and shining, the color of her cheeks was real, breaking close to the surface from the strong young pump of her heart. Her body hovered delicately on the last edge of childhood—she was almost eighteen, nearly complete, but the dew was still on her.

As sea and sky appeared below them in a thin, hot line the mother said:

“Something tells me we’re not going to like this place.”

“I want to go home anyhow,” the girl answered.

在法国里维埃拉风光宜人的海滨地区，大约位于马赛①与意大利边境的中途，坐落着一家高大气派、玫瑰色的旅馆。挺拔的棕榈树给富丽堂皇的旅馆正门带来一片阴凉，门前延伸出一小块亮晶晶的沙滩。近来，这里已成了显贵名流们的避暑胜地。十多年前，当英国房客在四月间去北方后，这房子就几乎没人住了。如今，旅馆四周却冒出了许多带游廊的平房，但本书的故事开始之时，也还只有十几幢圆顶的老式别墅。这些圆顶别墅已经衰败，就像戈赛的外宾旅馆与距此地五英里远的戛纳②之间茂密的松树林中的睡莲一样——

　　①法国东南部港市，为法国第二大城市。

　　②法国东南部港市，为著名的滨海游览胜地。

　　旅馆与它门前明亮的、跪拜地毯似的棕黄色沙滩浑然一体。清晨，远处戛纳的城市轮廓、粉红与浅黄相间的古老城堡及法意边界绛紫色的阿尔卑斯山倒映在水面上，在清澈的浅滩，随着海生植物摇曳出的圈圈细浪颤动着。时间不到八点，一个身穿蓝色浴衣的男子来到海滩，他先用清凉的海水浇泼身体，一边还大口呼吸，发出哼哼的声音，随后下水扑腾了一阵。他离去后，沙滩与海湾清静了一个时辰。远处的海面上，商船缓缓西行，餐厅侍者在旅馆的院子里大声说话，松树上的露水渐渐地干了。又过了一个时辰，汽车喇叭才开始在沿着历史上摩尔人①居住的丘陵地带蜿蜒曲折的公路上鸣响，那地方正好将法国的沿海地区与真正的普罗旺斯②地区分隔开来——

　　①北非阿拉伯人，公元8世纪初曾征服伊比利亚半岛，一度侵入到法国境内。

　　②法国古省名，范围西起罗纳河，东至凡尔河，南至地中海，历史上曾以诗歌和武侠著称。

　　离海滩一英里远的地方，松树让位给了落满灰尘的杨树，那儿有一个孤零零的铁路小站。一九二五年六月的一个早晨，一辆折篷汽车载着一位夫人和她的女儿向戈赛旅馆驰来。母亲脸上尚有往日的风韵，这风韵不久就会被颓丧的心情蚕食。她的神态令人愉悦地兼备了安详与明达事理，然而，人们的目光很快就会移向她的女儿，她那粉红色的手掌似乎有着魔力，她的双颊焕发出迷人的光彩，就像孩子们傍晚洗过冷水浴后红扑扑的小脸蛋一样可爱。她那漂亮而开阔的前额舒缓地上伸到发际，金黄色的头发像一枚盾牌将额头掩起，再蓬松出一头波浪形鬈发。她那对水汪汪的大眼睛晶莹亮丽，闪烁着光芒。她的双颊天然红润，那是从她有力跳动的年轻的心脏里迸发出的色彩。她的体态微妙地徘徊在孩提时代的最后边缘——她就要满十八岁了，她几乎完全长成妇人，然而少女时代的影子仍在她身上如清晨的露水般若隐若现。

　　大海慢慢地在她们的南面显现，与天空交接成一条细长、炽热的线条，这时母亲说：

　　“我觉得我们不会喜欢这个地方。”

　　“我也有些想家了。”姑娘答道。

Her mother was her best friend and had put every last possibility into the guiding of her, not so rare a thing in the theatrical profession, but rather special in that Mrs. Elsie Speers was not recompensing herself for a defeat of her own. She had no personal bitterness or resentments about life—twice satisfactorily married and twice widowed, her cheerful stoicism had each time deepened. One of her husbands had been a cavalry officer and one an army doctor, and they both left something to her that she tried to present intact to Rosemary. By not sparing Rosemary she had made her hard—by not sparing her own labor and devotion she had cultivated an idealism in Rosemary, which at present was directed toward herself and saw the world through her eyes. So that while Rosemary was a "simple" child she was protected by a double sheath of her mother's armor and her own—she had a mature distrust of the trivial, the facile and the vulgar. However, with Rosemary's sudden success in pictures Mrs. Speers felt that it was time she were spiritually weaned; it would please rather than pain her if this somewhat bouncing, breathless and exigent idealism would focus on something except herself.

母亲是她最好的朋友，总是尽心尽意地指点她，这种状况在演艺界也许并不少见，但需要指出的是，埃尔西-斯皮尔斯夫人这么做并非为补偿她自己所遇到的挫折。她生活中并没有什么个人的苦楚或怨恨——她两次称心如意地结婚，又两次守寡，但每经历一次，她那心悦诚服的禁欲主义情感就愈加深厚。她的一个丈夫曾当过骑兵军官，另一个是军医。他们对她都有些影响，而她想要把这些影响完全转移给萝丝玛丽。她从不放纵萝丝玛丽，她要让她长得健壮；她也毫不吝惜自己的辛劳和热心，要在萝丝玛丽身上培养一种理想主义。眼下，她已多少接受了这种理想主义，并学会用自己的眼睛来看世界。因而，当萝丝玛丽还是个“单纯的”孩子时，她就得到由她母亲的爱心和她自己组成的双层外壳的保护。她少年老成，不信任那些浅薄。浮夸和平庸的人，然而，由于萝丝玛丽在电影界一举成名，斯皮尔斯夫人觉得该让她在精神上断奶了。即使这种生气勃勃的、多少有点心气浮躁、好高骛远的理想主义将会关系到与她无关的一些事物，她也会由此感到高兴而不是忧伤。

With half an hour to wait for her train Rosemary sat down in the Café des Alliés on the Croisette, where the trees made a green twilight over the tables and an orchestra wooed an imaginary public of cosmopolites with the Nice Carnival Song and last year's American tune. She had bought Le Temps and The Saturday Evening Post for her mother, and as she drank her citronade she opened the latter at the memoirs of a Russian princess, finding the dim conventions of the nineties realer and nearer than the headlines of the French paper. It was the same feeling that had oppressed her at the hotel—accustomed to seeing the starkest grotesqueries of a continent heavily underlined as comedy or tragedy, untrained to the task of separating out the essential for herself, she now began to feel that French life was empty and stale. This feeling was surcharged by listening to the sad tunes of the orchestra, reminiscent of the melancholy music played for acrobats in vaudeville. She was glad to go back to Gausse's Hotel.

Her shoulders were too burned to swim with the next day, so she and her mother hired a car—after much haggling, for Rosemary had formed her valuations of money in France—and drove along the Riviera, the delta of many rivers. The chauffeur, a Russian Czar of the period of Ivan the Terrible, was a self-appointed guide, and the resplendent names—Cannes, Nice, Monte Carlo—began to glow through their torpid camouflage, whispering of old kings come here to dine or die, of rajahs tossing Buddha's eyes to English ballerinas, of Russian princes turning the weeks into Baltic twilights in the lost caviare days. Most of all, there was the scent of the Russians along the coast—their closed book shops and grocery stores. Ten years ago, when the season ended in April, the doors of the Orthodox Church were locked, and the sweet champagnes they favored were put away until their return. "We'll be back next season," they said, but this was premature, for they were never coming back any more.

It was pleasant to drive back to the hotel in the late afternoon, above a sea as mysteriously colored as the agates and cornelians of childhood, green as green milk, blue as laundry water, wine dark. It was pleasant to pass people eating outside their doors, and to hear the fierce mechanical pianos behind the vines of country estaminets. When they turned off the Corniche d'Or and down to Gausse's Hotel through the darkening banks of trees, set one behind another in many greens, the moon already hovered over the ruins of the aqueducts… .

Somewhere in the hills behind the hotel there was a dance, and Rosemary listened to the music through the ghostly moonshine of her mosquito net, realizing that there was gaiety too somewhere about, and she thought of the nice people on the beach. She thought she might meet them in the morning, but they obviously formed a self-sufficient little group, and once their umbrellas, bamboo rugs, dogs, and children were set out in place the part of the plage was literally fenced in. She resolved in any case not to spend her last two mornings with the other ones.

坐火车还得等上半小时，萝丝玛丽走进位于拉克鲁瓦塞特大街①的阿里埃咖啡馆。夕阳将一片绿色的树影洒在咖啡桌上，一支管弦乐队在演奏《狂欢曲》和去年才问世的一些美国乐曲，欢迎他们想象中的周游列国的宾客。她为母亲买了法文的《时代》和英文的《星期六晚邮报》。她一边喝着柠檬水，一边翻开《星期六晚邮报》，读一位旧俄公主的回忆录。她觉得九十年代的一些陈旧的习俗要比法国报纸上的新闻摘要更真实、更亲近一些。在旅馆里，正是这种感觉压迫着她——她习惯于将一段黑体字摘要中的奇闻怪事看作是悲剧或喜剧，她还没有为自己提取事情的实质的素养。她开始觉得法国的生活既空洞又乏味。听着乐队奏出的忧伤的曲凋，这种感觉涌上心头，让她回想起杂耍演出中为杂技演员弹奏的令人忧郁的音乐。她乐意回到戈赛的旅馆去——

她的肩膀晒得太厉害，第二天无法再去游泳。因为萝丝玛丽在法国养成了掂量钱袋的习惯，母女俩经过一番讨价还价后方才雇了辆汽车，沿着河网密布的里维埃拉三角洲兜风。这位汽车司机，颇像一位恐怖的伊凡①时代的俄国沙皇，自告奋勇地充当了导游。于是，那些灿烂的名字——戛纳、尼斯②、蒙特卡洛③——开始透过它们了无生气的外表熠熠生辉，仿佛在叙说陈年旧事：帝王们幸临这些城市宴请宾客或驾崩于此；印度酋长面对英国芭蕾舞女如佛陀一样低垂双目；俄国王子在失却了风雅的日子里一连几个星期倘祥于波罗的海的夕阳里。尤其是，海岸一带有俄国人留下的遗迹——他们关闭了的书店和杂货铺。十年前，当旅游季节在四月结束时，东正教教堂便关门上锁，他们喜欢喝的芬芳的香槟酒被贮存起来，等他们返回时享用。“到下一个季节，我们就回来。”他们夸日道。然而，说这话为时过早，因为他们再也没回来——

①指伊凡四世（1530-1584），又称“雷帝”，因对臣民实行残是统治，有“恐怖的伊凡”之称。
②法国东南部海港城市，著名的旅游胜地。
③摩纳哥公国城市，濒地中海，是世界著名赌城。

傍晚时分驱车回旅馆真是赏心悦目，犹如给儿童用的玛瑙和玉髓饰品着色一样，海的上方也染着一层神奇的色彩：绿如草汁，蓝如洗衣水，暗红如葡萄酒。沿途看见农户在门前用餐，听见乡村酒吧葡萄架后传出的尖厉、单调的钢琴声，让人心旷神恰。当汽车拐弯离开“金峭壁”，在暮色中穿过绿树成行、芳草连片的堤岸，驰向戈赛旅馆时，月亮已在废弃的输水栈桥上方徘徊……

旅馆后边的某处山坡上有个舞会，睡在蚊帐里的萝丝玛丽聆听着随那朦胧的月光传人的音乐声，意识到处处都有欢乐。她不禁想起海滩上遇到的那些有教养的人来。她想，明天早晨也许会见到他们，但他们显然已结成一个妄自尊大的小团体，他们一旦将遮阳伞、竹毯、狗和孩子安置好，也就意味着他们将一部分海滩圈起来了。她打定主意无论如何在最后两个上午得加入这个团体而不是混迹于其他什么人群中。

He seemed kind and charming—his voice promised that he would take care of her, and that a little later he would open up whole new worlds for her, unroll an endless succession of magnificent possibilities. He managed the introduction so that her name wasn't mentioned and then let her know easily that everyone knew who she was but were respecting the completeness of her private life—a courtesy that Rosemary had not met with save from professional people since her success.

Nicole Diver, her brown back hanging from her pearls, was looking through a recipe book for chicken Maryland. She was about twenty-four, Rosemary guessed—her face could have been described in terms of conventional prettiness, but the effect was that it had been made first on the heroic scale with strong structure and marking, as if the features and vividness of brow and coloring, everything we associate with temperament and character had been molded with a Rodinesque intention, and then chiseled away in the direction of prettiness to a point where a single slip would have irreparably diminished its force and quality. With the mouth the sculptor had taken desperate chances—it was the cupid's bow of a magazine cover, yet it shared the distinction of the rest.

他显得和蔼可亲、风度翩翩。听他口气，他一定会关照她。稍后，他就会为她打开一个全新的世界，展现出无穷无尽的壮丽的前景。他给她作介绍而设法不提及她的名宇，并让她很快明白，大家都知道她是谁，但完全尊重她的私生活——这种礼貌，自她成名以来，除了来自职业老手，萝丝玛丽还没有见识过。

尼科尔-戴弗，珍珠项链贴在褐色的背脊上，正翻阅着一本制作马里兰鸡的食谱。她约莫二十四岁，萝丝玛丽估计——她的脸可以用“常见的美丽”这样的词来形容，然而给人留下的印象是：它的强健的脸架子最初是按英雄的模式来构造的，其面容及表情的独特和生动，以及所有可以同气质和特性相联系的方面，仿佛是根据罗丹①的意图塑造成的，随后再雕琢出美丽来，而且恰到好处，稍有闪失，就会无可弥补地损伤它所具有的力量和特质。对这张嘴，雕塑家更是费尽心机——这简直是杂志封面上的丘比特②之弓，当然，它与脸的其它部位也相吻合——

①罗丹（1840-1917），法国著名雕塑家。

She looked in turn at the three men, temporarily expropriating them. All three were personable in different ways; all were of a special gentleness that she felt was part of their lives, past and future, not circumstanced by events, not at all like the company manners of actors, and she detected also a far-reaching delicacy that was different from the rough and ready good fellowship of directors, who represented the intellectuals in her life. Actors and directors—those were the only men she had ever known, those and the heterogeneous, indistinguishable mass of college boys, interested only in love at first sight, whom she had met at the Yale prom last fall.

These three were different. Barban was less civilized, more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even perfunctory. Abe North had, under his shyness, a desperate humor that amused but puzzled her. Her serious nature distrusted its ability to make a supreme impression on him.

But Dick Diver—he was all complete there. Silently she admired him. His complexion was reddish and weather-burned, so was his short hair—a light growth of it rolled down his arms and hands. His eyes were of a bright, hard blue. His nose was somewhat pointed and there was never any doubt at whom he was looking or talking—and this is a flattering attention, for who looks at us?—glances fall upon us, curious or disinterested, nothing more. His voice, with some faint Irish melody running through it, wooed the world, yet she felt the layer of hardness in him, of self-control and of self-discipline, her own virtues. Oh, she chose him, and Nicole, lifting her head saw her choose him, heard the little sigh at the fact that he was already possessed.

她挨个儿打量那三个男子，似乎眼下他们将归她所有。他们三个都是翩翩君子，并且各具特色。他们都有一种特别的温文尔雅的风度，她觉得这种风度来自他们的生活，是他们过去及未来生活的一部分，而并非因事而异，也全然不同于电影演员的交际方式。她还辨认出一种内在的优雅，有别于导演们的粗俗和善于交际的本领，而导演则是她生平遇到的有学识的人的代表。演员和导演——她只熟悉这些男人，这些人同那些有着不同来历，但又千篇一律的学院小子一个样，只对一见钟情的恋爱感兴趣，她去年秋天在耶鲁大学的舞会上见识过那些小伙子。

这三个男子不尽相同。巴尔邦风雅不足，多了点怀疑和嘲讽的味道。他为人拘谨，甚至有点心不在焉。艾贝-诺思显得腼腆，然而他那种令人惊愕的幽默让她既高兴又困惑。她担心自己天性严肃，不能给他留下深刻的印象。

但是迪克-戴弗——这儿他最完美。她不声不响地欣赏着他。他的皮肤微红，被太阳晒得黑黝黝的，短短的汗毛也略显红色——那细细的一层汗毛从膀子延伸到手背。他的眼睛是蓝色的，明亮而锐利。他的鼻子尖尖的，他在看谁或与谁交谈时总是目不转睛地注视着对方。这是一种讨人喜欢的注视，因为有谁在注意我们呢？目光落到我们身上，好奇的或无动于衷的，不过如此吧。他的嗓音，带着一种轻微的爱尔兰人的悦耳音调，仿佛要取悦世人，然而，她却感到他身上有一股硬气，一种自我克制和自我约束的气质，这也是她自己具备的美德。哦，她选择了他。尼科尔抬起头来，明白她选择了他，也听到一声低微的叹息，因为他早已被别人占有了。

Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naïveté responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the world's bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them—in reality a qualitative change had already set in that was not at all apparent to Rosemary.

She stood with them as they took sherry and ate crackers. Dick Diver looked at her with cold blue eyes; his kind, strong mouth said thoughtfully and deliberately:

"You're the only girl I've seen for a long time that actually did look like something blooming."

In her mother's lap afterward Rosemary cried and cried.
"I love him, Mother. I'm desperately in love with him—I never knew I could feel that way about anybody. And he's married and I like her too—it's just hopeless. Oh, I love him so!"
"I'm curious to meet him."
"She invited us to dinner Friday."
"If you're in love it ought to make you happy. You ought to laugh."
Rosemary looked up and gave a beautiful little shiver of her face and laughed. Her mother always had a great influence on her.

萝丝玛丽见到这条泳裤很是兴奋。她天真稚嫩，对戴弗夫妇这种奢华的单纯满心喜欢。她并没有意识到它的复杂，它的世故；也没有意识到他们的这种生活方式其实是更注重质量，而不是拥有一大堆世界各地的廉价品；她同样意识不到他们行为举止的朴素大方，他们的和蔼及友善，他们对普通美德的强调，都离不开同神灵作艰苦的讨价还价，都是通过一系列她还无从推断的斗争而获得的。此时此刻，戴弗夫妇外在地代表着一个阶层的最大程度的进化，这使得大多数人相形见细——事实上，一种质的变化已经开始，而萝丝玛丽竟漠然无知。

他们喝雪利酒，吃饼干时，她就和他们站在一起。迪克-戴弗的那双蓝色眼睛冷冷地看着她，他的嘴显得可亲而又坚毅，他周到而又从容地说：

“你是很久以来我所见过的，唯一看上去真正如花似玉的姑娘。”

后来她伏在母亲的腿上哭了又哭。
“我爱他，妈妈。我爱他爱得要命——我从没有想到我会对谁产生那样的感情。他已经结婚了，我还是喜欢她——这肯定是没有指望的。哦，我太爱他了！”
“我倒很想见见他。”
“戴弗夫人邀请我们周五去用餐。”
“要是你在恋爱，你应该觉得快乐。你应该笑的。”
萝丝玛丽仰起头来，脸庞优美地微微一动，笑了。她母亲始终对她有很大影响。

Feeling good from the rosy wine at lunch, Nicole Diver folded her arms high enough for the artificial camellia on her shoulder to touch her cheek, and went out into her lovely grassless garden. The garden was bounded on one side by the house, from which it flowed and into which it ran, on two sides by the old village, and on the last by the cliff falling by ledges to the sea.

Along the walls on the village side all was dusty, the wriggling vines, the lemon and eucalyptus trees, the casual wheel-barrow, left only a moment since, but already grown into the path, atrophied and faintly rotten. Nicole was invariably somewhat surprised that by turning in the other direction past a bed of peonies she walked into an area so green and cool that the leaves and petals were curled with tender damp.

Knotted at her throat she wore a lilac scarf that even in the achromatic sunshine cast its color up to her face and down around her moving feet in a lilac shadow. Her face was hard, almost stern, save for the soft gleam of piteous doubt that looked from her green eyes. Her once fair hair had darkened, but she was lovelier now at twenty-four than she had been at eighteen, when her hair was brighter than she.

Following a walk marked by an intangible mist of bloom that followed the white border stones she came to a space overlooking the sea where there were lanterns asleep in the fig trees and a big table and wicker chairs and a great market umbrella from Sienna, all gathered about an enormous pine, the biggest tree in the garden. She paused there a moment, looking absently at a growth of nasturtiums and iris tangled at its foot, as though sprung from a careless handful of seeds, listening to the plaints and accusations of some nursery squabble in the house. When this died away on the summer air, she walked on, between kaleidoscopic peonies massed in pink clouds, black and brown tulips and fragile mauve-stemmed roses, transparent like sugar flowers in a confectioner's window—until, as if the scherzo of color could reach no further intensity, it broke off suddenly in mid-air, and moist steps went down to a level five feet below.

午餐时喝了玫瑰葡萄酒感觉挺好，尼科尔-戴弗高高地抱起双臂，肩膀上的假山茶花几乎要碰上她的面颊了。她走出户外来到那可爱的没有杂草的花园。花园的一边与住房相接，并从这儿延伸出去，深入到房子的庭院；另两边毗邻一个古老的村落；最后一边靠着向海岸礁石倾斜的悬崖。

沿着村子一边的围墙，那儿的树木落满了灰尘。扭结的葡萄藤，还有柠檬树和按树，不久前被人随意丢弃在路上现已下陷的手推车，都有些衰败腐烂了。尼科尔总会感到意外，如果她换一个方向，经过一块芍药苗圃，便可走进一个绿枝掩映下的阴凉之地，那儿的树叶和花瓣上萦绕着一片轻柔的水汽。

她戴了一方淡紫色的薄头巾，在颈前系了个结。甚至在白晃晃的日光下，头巾也把它的色彩映在她的脸上，投到在一团淡紫色阴影中移动着的脚旁。她神情凝重，几乎有点冷峻，只是她那双蓝眼睛闪动着让人怜爱的温柔而迷离的光芒。她的一头金发已失去了光泽，然而，她现在虽然二十四岁了，却比十八岁时更加妩媚，尽管那时她的头发比她本人还要亮丽。

沿着白色界石后面如烟似雾般的花丛中的一条小径，她来到一处能够眺望大海的地方。那儿有几只灯笼静静地挂在无花果树枝上。一张大桌子，几把柳条椅和一把锡耶纳①出产的大型商用篷伞，都摆放在一棵高大的松树下面，这棵树比园子里所有其它的树都要粗壮。她在那儿歇了一会，漫不经心地望着一丛丛旱金莲和缠结在它根部的鸢尾，这些花仿佛是随手撒下的一把种子生长出来的。她还听到从住所的保育室传来埋怨声和指责声。当这些声音在夏天的微风中消逝时，她又往前走去，路两旁盛开着粉红色云团般的多姿多态的芍药花、黑色和棕色的郁金香花和娇嫩的紫茎的玫瑰花，这些花就像出售甜食的商店橱窗里的糖制花朵一样晶莹玲珑——她走着走着，直到这色彩的乐曲似乎无法达到更强的节奏，而在半空中蓦然停顿。潮湿的台阶通向下面五英尺的地方——

Here there was a well with the boarding around it dank and slippery even on the brightest days. She went up the stairs on the other side and into the vegetable garden; she walked rather quickly; she liked to be active, though at times she gave an impression of repose that was at once static and evocative. This was because she knew few words and believed in none, and in the world she was rather silent, contributing just her share of urbane humor with a precision that approached meagreness. But at the moment when strangers tended to grow uncomfortable in the presence of this economy she would seize the topic and rush off with it, feverishly surprised with herself—then bring it back and relinquish it abruptly, almost timidly, like an obedient retriever, having been adequate and something more.

这儿有一口水井，周围铺有木板，即使在最晴朗的日子里，井边上也是湿漉漉、滑溜溜的。她从另一头登上台阶，走进一个菜园。她走得相当快。她活泼好动，尽管有时给人一种们静的印象，既恬淡又动人。她识字不多，也不信任什么人，因而在这个世界上她就宁可保持沉默，然而近于贫乏的拘泥还是无损于她那优雅的气质。但有的时候，当陌生人对她的寡言少语感到不快时，她会抢过话题，急急忙忙地谈论起来，这时她自己也不免大吃一惊——随后把话题带回来，几乎是胆怯地一下子扔掉，如同一条乖巧的猎犬，表现得恰到好处。


He went back into his house and Nicole saw that one of his most characteristic moods was upon him, the excitement that swept everyone up into it and was inevitably followed by his own form of melancholy, which he never displayed but at which she guessed. This excitement about things reached an intensity out of proportion to their importance, generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with people. Save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated and uncritical love. The reaction came when he realized the waste and extravagance involved. He sometimes looked back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy an impersonal blood lust.

Rosemary bubbled with delight at the trunks. Her naïveté responded whole-heartedly to the expensive simplicity of the Divers, unaware of its complexity and its lack of innocence, unaware that it was all a selection of quality rather than quantity from the run of the world's bazaar; and that the simplicity of behavior also, the nursery-like peace and good will, the emphasis on the simpler virtues, was part of a desperate bargain with the gods and had been attained through struggles she could not have guessed at. At that moment the Divers represented externally the exact furthermost evolution of a class, so that most people seemed awkward beside them—in reality a qualitative change had already set in that was not at all apparent to Rosemary.

他回到他的房间去。尼科尔清楚，现在他处于一种最特别的心境之中，这是一种要把所有人都卷进来的兴奋，而随之而来的必然是他自己的忧郁，虽然他从未表现出来，但她认为他有这种忧郁。对某些事兴奋到这样一种程度，就与这些事本身的重要性不相称了，而结果是产生出一种真正异乎寻常的对人的喜好。除了很少一些硬心肠、疑心重的人，他具有让人迷恋、痴情的魅力。但他一旦意识到结交过程中的浪费和做作，便会产生这样的心理反应。他有时会满怀惊骇回顾他引发的情感的狂欢，就好像一位将军注视为满足他那野蛮的嗜血欲望而下令进行的一场大屠杀。

But to be included in Dick Diver's world for a while was a remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many years. He won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that it could be examined only in its effect. Then, without caution, lest the first bloom of the relation wither, he opened the gate to his amusing world. So long as they subscribed to it completely, their happiness was his preoccupation, but at the first flicker of doubt as to its all-inclusiveness he evaporated before their eyes, leaving little communicable memory of what he had said or done.

但是要被戴弗的世界接纳，哪怕只是一会儿，也是一种很特别的经历。人们相信：他为他们做了专门的安排，因为他能认识到他们性格的叮贵的独特性，而这种独特性多年来为生活中的妥协所淹没了。他对人体贴人微的关怀和优雅的风度很快能赢得人们的好感。他所表现出来的这种关怀和风度没有丝毫的犹豫和做作，因而只有凭借结果才能加以识别。另外，为了不使相互关系中的第一枝花朵枯萎，他毫无顾忌地敞开通向他那个诙谐有趣的世界的大门。只要他们心悦诚服地领受这一切，他们的快乐就是他首要考虑的事，但只要他们对它的丰富多彩闪出一丝怀疑来，他就会在他们的眼前消失，而他的言谈举止也就不会给人留下什么值得一提的印象了。

At eight-thirty that evening he came out to meet his first guests, his coat carried rather ceremoniously, rather promisingly, in his hand, like a toreador's cape. It was characteristic that after greeting Rosemary and her mother he waited for them to speak first, as if to allow them the reassurance of their own voices in new surroundings.

To resume Rosemary's point of view it should be said that, under the spell of the climb to Tarmes and the fresher air, she and her mother looked about appreciatively. Just as the personal qualities of extraordinary people can make themselves plain in an unaccustomed change of expression, so the intensely calculated perfection of Villa Diana transpired all at once through such minute failures as the chance apparition of a maid in the background or the perversity of a cork. While the first guests arrived bringing with them the excitement of the night, the domestic activity of the day receded past them gently, symbolized by the Diver children and their governess still at supper on the terrace.

那天晚上八点半，他出门迎候他的第一批客人。他恭敬有礼，从容自信，外套拿在手里，犹如斗牛士拎着他的披风。在同萝丝玛丽和她的母亲打过招呼后，他等着让她们先开日，仿佛要让她们在新的环境里对自已的声音有足够的信心，这种方式是颇为独特的。

若接着叙述萝丝玛丽，应该说，她走了一阵上塔姆斯的山路，呼吸了山间清新的空气，此刻她和她的母亲正兴致勃勃地四下观望。正如一个非凡人物的个人品质能够在一种不习惯的表情变化中显露出来，黛安娜别墅的那种苦心营造的完美也会因诸如一个女仆在背后贸然出现，或一只瓶子的软木塞拔不出来这样细小的差错而顷刻间显露得清清楚楚。随着第一批客人的光临，以及随之而来的晚会的喧闹，主人家的这一天的日常家庭活动就悄悄地离别而去。戴弗家的孩子和他们的家庭教师仍在露天平台晚餐就是这种家庭生活的一个标志。

She felt far from him. The undertone of his words repelled her and she withdrew her adoration for the Divers from the profanity of his bitterness. She was glad he was not next to her at dinner and she was still thinking of his words "especially her" as they moved toward the table in the garden.

For a moment now she was beside Dick Diver on the path. Alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded into the surety that he knew everything. For a year, which was forever, she had had money and a certain celebrity and contact with the celebrated, and these latter had presented themselves merely as powerful enlargements of the people with whom the doctor's widow and her daughter had associated in a hôtel-pension in Paris. Rosemary was a romantic and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities on that score. Her mother, with the idea of a career for Rosemary, would not tolerate any such spurious substitutes as the excitations available on all sides, and indeed Rosemary was already beyond that—she was In the movies but not at all At them. So when she had seen approval of Dick Diver in her mother's face it meant that he was "the real thing"; it meant permission to go as far as she could.

"I was watching you," he said, and she knew he meant it. "We've grown very fond of you."

"I fell in love with you the first time I saw you," she said quietly. He pretended not to have heard, as if the compliment were purely formal.

"New friends," he said, as if it were an important point, "can often have a better time together than old friends."

With that remark, which she did not understand precisely, she found herself at the table, picked out by slowly emerging lights against the dark dusk. A chord of delight struck inside her when she saw that Dick had taken her mother on his right hand; for herself she was between Luis Campion and Brady.

Surcharged with her emotion she turned to Brady with the intention of confiding in him, but at her first mention of Dick a hard-boiled sparkle in his eyes gave her to understand that he refused the fatherly office. In turn she was equally firm when he tried to monopolize her hand, so they talked shop or rather she listened while he talked shop, her polite eyes never leaving his face, but her mind was so definitely elsewhere that she felt he must guess the fact. Intermittently she caught the gist of his sentences and supplied the rest from her subconscious, as one picks up the striking of a clock in the middle with only the rhythm of the first uncounted strokes lingering in the mind.

她觉得同他不是一路人。他这些暧昧的话让她反感，而听了这番苦涩的直露的表白，她不由得收回了对戴弗夫妇的推崇。她很高兴吃饭时他没有挨着她。他们一起向花园里的餐桌走去时，她仍然在琢磨他所说的“尤其是她”这句话。

在路上的时候，曾经有一刻她走在迪克-戴弗的身边。他沉着而敏锐，周边的一切都被他那种通晓一切的自信所包容。有过一年——那是难以忘怀的，她有钱，有一定的名气，还同名人来往。这些名人其实不过是军医的孀妇及其女儿在巴黎膳宿公寓旅馆所接触的社交圈子的大规模扩展而已。萝丝玛丽是个浪漫的姑娘，就此而言，她的生活还没有给她提供许多令人满意的机会。她母亲对萝丝玛丽寄予厚望，不会容忍唾手可得，让人兴奋一阵的这类虚假的替代者，而萝丝玛丽也确实已经超越这一层次了——她步入了电影界，然而还没有彻底站稳脚跟，所以当她从母亲脸上看出她对迪克-戴弗的赞许时，这就意味着他是个“真实的目标”，就意味着她可以自行其是了。

“我一直在注视你。”他说。她明白他的意思。“我们越来越喜欢你了。”

“我第一次见到你的时候就爱上你了。”她轻轻地说。

他装作没有听见，只当是一句纯粹场面上的恭维话。

“新朋友，”他说，仿佛这是很重要的一点，“常常比老朋友相处得更愉快。”

他的这句话她并没有真正听懂，这时她发现已经来到餐桌旁。灯光渐渐亮起来，而四周则是一片黄昏的幽暗。当她看到迪克右手挽着她母亲时，欢乐的旋律不禁在心头荡漾起来。她自己坐在了路易斯-坎布恩和布雷迪的中间。

她满怀激情地转向布雷迪，想要对他说说心里话，但她一提起迪克来，他的双眼就射出凶巴巴的目光，这使她明白他拒绝扮演父亲般的角色。反过来，当他试图独占她的爱情的时候，她也表现出同样的坚决，因而他们只是说些本行业的话，或者很大程度上她听他说些行话。她的眼睛有礼貌地一直看着他，但她如此地心不在焉，连她自己也觉得他肯定能猜出真相了。她偶尔也能听明白他话里的意思，并在下意识里把这些话接下去，犹如一个人在钟声敲到一半时，只是凭心里回荡着的，而起初并未计数的敲击节奏就能继续敲下去一样。

Then came Dick, with his arms full of the slack he had taken up from others, deeply merged in his own party.

Then her mother, forever perfect.

Then Barban talking to her mother with an urbane fluency that made Rosemary like him again. Then Nicole. Rosemary saw her suddenly in a new way and found her one of the most beautiful people she had ever known. Her face, the face of a saint, a viking Madonna, shone through the faint motes that snowed across the candlelight, drew down its flush from the wine-colored lanterns in the pine. She was still as still.

随后是迪克，他从容地掌握着场上的谈话气氛，全神贯注地照料他的小团体。

再过去是母亲，她永远是完美的。

再过去是同她母亲谈话的巴尔邦，他优雅而流畅的谈吐使萝丝玛丽又一次为他心动。再过去是尼科尔。萝丝玛丽突然对她有了新的认识，发现她是她认识的人里面最漂亮的一个。她的脸庞，犹如一位天使的脸庞，北欧圣母的脸庞，在依稀可见的尘埃中闪着光彩。这些尘埃在烛光周围飞扬，从松树上的深红色灯笼中投下一片红光。她仍然是文文静静的。

Next was Campion, managing somehow to restrain his most blatant effeminacy, and even to visit upon those near him a certain disinterested motherliness. Then Mary North with a face so merry that it was impossible not to smile back into the white mirrors of her teeth—the whole area around her parted lips was a lovely little circle of delight.

Finally Brady, whose heartiness became, moment by moment, a social thing instead of a crude assertion and reassertion of his own mental health, and his preservation of it by a detachment from the frailties of others.

Rosemary, as dewy with belief as a child from one of Mrs. Burnett's vicious tracts, had a conviction of homecoming, of a return from the derisive and salacious improvisations of the frontier. There were fireflies riding on the dark air and a dog baying on some low and far-away ledge of the cliff. The table seemed to have risen a little toward the sky like a mechanical dancing platform, giving the people around it a sense of being alone with each other in the dark universe, nourished by its only food, warmed by its only lights. And, as if a curious hushed laugh from Mrs. McKisco were a signal that such a detachment from the world had been attained, the two Divers began suddenly to warm and glow and expand, as if to make up to their guests, already so subtly assured of their importance, so flattered with politeness, for anything they might still miss from that country well left behind. Just for a moment they seemed to speak to every one at the table, singly and together, assuring them of their friendliness, their affection. And for a moment the faces turned up toward them were like the faces of poor children at a Christmas tree. Then abruptly the table broke up—the moment when the guests had been daringly lifted above conviviality into the rarer atmosphere of sentiment, was over before it could be irreverently breathed, before they had half realized it was there.

But the diffused magic of the hot sweet South had withdrawn into them—the soft-pawed night and the ghostly wash of the Mediterranean far below—the magic left these things and melted into the two Divers and became part of them. Rosemary watched Nicole pressing upon her mother a yellow evening bag she had admired, saying, "I think things ought to belong to the people that like them"—and then sweeping into it all the yellow articles she could find, a pencil, a lipstick, a little note book, "because they all go together."

边上是坎布恩，他正多少设法抑制他身上那股明显的女人气，甚至要用带着冷漠的母性态度对待坐在他身旁的人。再过去是玛丽-诺思，她一脸的快乐，面对她一口洁白的牙齿，要不回报她微笑是不可能的——她那张开的嘴唇四周恰似一个优美、欣悦的圆圈。

最边上是布雷迪，他那种直露的态度也渐渐变得随和一些了，不再粗鲁地反复标榜他自己心智健全，也不再声称要疏远他人的弱点来维护这种心智健全。

萝丝玛丽如同伯内特夫人①的一本有争议的小册子里的孩子那样，怀抱纯洁的信念，确信已踏上回家之路，已经从那边远地区可笑和放荡的临时聚居区返回家乡。萤火虫在夜空中飞舞，远处有只狗在悬崖下边的礁石上吠叫。餐桌犹如一座活动舞台，朝星空冉冉上升，坐在餐桌边的人们有一种在漆黑的宇宙中彼此隔绝的感觉，仅靠桌上那点食物果腹，只有桌上那点光亮暖身。这时，麦基斯克夫人的古怪的、压低的笑声像是一个信号，表明他们已经超脱了尘世。戴弗夫妇突然活跃起来，欢声笑语，兴奋无比，仿佛要向那些已经深信自身的尊贵并得到礼遇的客人巴结讨好，以弥补他们在远远抛在后边的世界里未得到的东西。有一阵他们似乎同餐桌边的每一个人说话，或单个或两个一起，证明他们的友善和爱心。这时，那些仰望着他们的面孔犹如望着圣诞树的可怜的孩子们的面孔。然而餐桌突然破裂了——将客人们大胆地提升超出宴饮水平而进入情感的纯净氛围的时刻结束了，这时，他们还来不及细细品味，甚至还没有意识到这一氛围的存在——

但是那炎热、诱人的南风散发出的魔力已侵人他们的身躯——远处是地中海清柔的夜晚和幽幽的波涛——魔力留下夜色和波涛，将它们融人戴弗夫妇身上，并成为他们的一个部分。萝丝玛丽看见尼科尔将一只她母亲看上的晚间用的黄色拎包塞给她，说：“我觉得物品应属于喜欢它的人。”说完便把她能找到的所有黄色物品一古脑儿塞进包里：一枝铅笔、一管口红、一本小巧的日记本。“拿着吧，它们是成套的。”

"Of all the narrow-minded excuses," McKisco looked around to establish a derisive liaison with some one else, but without success. He had no idea what he was up against in Barban, neither of the simplicity of the other man's bag of ideas nor of the complexity of his training. McKisco knew what ideas were, and as his mind grew he was able to recognize and sort an increasing number of them—but faced by a man whom he considered "dumb," one in whom he found no ideas he could recognize as such, and yet to whom he could not feel personally superior, he jumped at the conclusion that Barban was the end product of an archaic world, and as such, worthless. McKisco's contacts with the princely classes in America had impressed upon him their uncertain and fumbling snobbery, their delight in ignorance and their deliberate rudeness, all lifted from the English with no regard paid to factors that make English philistinism and rudeness purposeful, and applied in a land where a little knowledge and civility buy more than they do anywhere else—an attitude which reached its apogee in the "Harvard manner" of about 1900. He thought that this Barban was of that type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of him—this led up to the trouble in which he presently found himself.

“多么狭隘的见解，”麦基斯克看看四周，想要找个志同道合者，但没有成功。他不明白在巴尔邦身上他遇到了什么问题，既不是对方将许多观念简单化，亦不是他所受教育的复杂性。麦基斯克知道什么是观念，随着他心智的发展，他能够识别和选择遇到的各种观念——然而，面对一个他认为是“笨蛋”的人，一个在其身上没有他能识别的观念的人，而他对此人又没有个人方面的优越感，他得出结论：巴尔邦是旧时代的最后产物，这样的人毫无价值可言。同美国公子哥儿的接触，麦基斯克有这样的印象：他们的多变、笨拙和势利，他们以无知为乐和故意的粗鲁行为，这一切都是从英国人那儿学来的，而且不考虑那些能转变英国市侩作风和粗鲁行为的因素，就将其运用到这样一块土地上，这儿只需一点儿知识和礼貌便可买到比其它任何地方更多的东西——这种态度的最充分的表现就是二十世纪初的所谓“哈佛作风”。他认为巴尔邦便是那种类型的人。他喝得醉醺醺的，忘了他原本是敬重巴尔邦的——这样就给他带来了麻烦，而此刻他自己也意识到了。

Rosemary dozed for three hours and then lay awake, suspended in the moonshine. Cloaked by the erotic darkness she exhausted the future quickly, with all the eventualities that might lead up to a kiss, but with the kiss itself as blurred as a kiss in pictures. She changed position in bed deliberately, the first sign of insomnia she had ever had, and tried to think with her mother's mind about the question. In this process she was often acute beyond her experience, with remembered things from old conversations that had gone into her half-heard.

萝丝玛丽迷迷糊糊地睡了三个小时，然后静静地躺在床上，任思绪在月光中倘佯。夜色簇拥着她，情思撩人。她对前景很快丧失了信心，她想即便到最后极有可能会亲吻一下，但这个吻会和电影里的吻一样散淡。她在床上悠闲地翻了个身，这是她有生以来第一次失眠的征兆。她试着用她母亲考虑问题的思路去想。在这种情况下，她的敏锐常常超出了她的经历，对过去那些听来的只言片语也能回忆起来。
 
Rosemary had never done much thinking, save about the illimitability of her mother's perfections, so this final severance of the umbilical cord disturbed her sleep. A false dawn sent the sky pressing through the tall French windows, and getting up she walked out on the terrace, warm to her bare feet. There were secret noises in the air, an insistent bird achieved an ill-natured triumph with regularity in the trees above the tennis court; footfalls followed a round drive in the rear of the hotel, taking their tone in turn from the dust road, the crushed-stone walk, the cement steps, and then reversing the process in going away. Beyond the inky sea and far up that high, black shadow of a hill lived the Divers. She thought of them both together, heard them still singing faintly a song like rising smoke, like a hymn, very remote in time and far away. Their children slept, their gate was shut for the night.
 
萝丝玛丽向来懒得动脑，除了对她母亲那种用之不竭的才情有过逻想，因而她母亲一旦将脐带最后剪断，她便睡不着觉了。一线黎明将天色送进高大的落地长窗，她从床上爬起来，赤裸着双脚走到外面尚有热气的平台上。夜空中传来神秘的声响。网球场那边的树上，一只坏脾气的鸟单调而得意洋洋地叫个不停。旅馆后边沿环形车道响起一阵脚步声，从不同的节奏听得出是走在泥土路上，碎石路上和水泥地上。随后又往回走，接着脚步声消失了。从墨一般的海上望过去，远处矗立着一座山的黑影。那儿住着戴弗夫妇。她想象他们俩在一起的情形，仿佛听到他们在轻轻地哼唱一支歌，这支歌犹如冉冉上升的烟云，犹如一支圣歌，回响在久远的年代和遥远的地方。他们的孩子睡着了，他们的大门在夜里关闭了。
 
Rosemary stood breathless as the voices moved away. She was at first even astonished—she had seen them in their relation to each other as people without personal exigencies—as something cooler. Now a strong current of emotion flowed through her, profound and unidentified. She did not know whether she was attracted or repelled, but only that she was deeply moved. It made her feel very alone as she went back into the restaurant, but it was touching to look in upon, and the passionate gratitude of Nicole's "Oh, do I!" echoed in her mind. The particular mood of the passage she had witnessed lay ahead of her; but however far she was from it her stomach told her it was all right—she had none of the aversion she had felt in the playing of certain love scenes in pictures.
 
萝丝玛丽大气不出地站在那儿，直到他们的声音渐渐远去。她起初甚至感到震惊，因为从他们相互之间的关系来看，她一直把他们当作那种没有肉体要求的人，当作那种感情冷漠的人。此刻，一股情感的激流流过她的全身，透心而朦胧。她不明白自己是欣羡还是反感，但唯一明白的是她自己被深深地打动了。遇到这种事，确实让人心动，尤其是尼科尔充满激情的话“哦，我爱你！”仍在她心头回响。她现在面临了她目睹的这幕情景的特殊氛围，但不管她与这种氛围的距离有多远，她自己的欲望告诉她，这是正常的——她并没有产生在出演某场爱情戏时常有的厌恶感。

Being far away from it she nevertheless irrevocably participated in it now, and shopping with Nicole she was much more conscious of the assignation than Nicole herself. She looked at Nicole in a new way, estimating her attractions. Certainly she was the most attractive woman Rosemary had ever met—with her hardness, her devotions and loyalties, and a certain elusiveness, which Rosemary, thinking now through her mother's middle-class mind, associated with her attitude about money. Rosemary spent money she had earned—she was here in Europe due to the fact that she had gone in the pool six times that January day with her temperature roving from 99° in the early morning to 103°, when her mother stopped it.

尽管这件事与她无关，但她现在无可避免地参与进去了。当她同尼科尔一起去购物时，她甚至比尼科尔本人更在意这次幽会。她从新的角度来观察尼科尔，估量她的吸引力。当然，她是萝丝玛丽所见过的最有吸引力的女子——她庄重、虔诚、忠实，还有某种令人难以捉摸的东西，这一切萝丝玛丽运用她母亲的中产阶级的思想方式来加以考虑，并把它们同她对金钱的看法联系起来。萝丝玛丽的钱是她自己挣来的——她之所以能在欧洲漫游，因为她在一月的某一天跳入水池六次，那天她的体温从早晨的99度慢慢上升到103度①，这时她母亲出来阻止了她.

With Nicole’s help Rosemary bought two dresses and two hats and four pairs of shoes with her money. Nicole bought from a great list that ran two pages, and bought the things in the windows besides. Everything she liked that she couldn’t possibly use herself, she bought as a present for a friend. She bought colored beads, folding beach cushions, artificial flowers, honey, a guest bed, bags, scarfs, love birds,miniatures for a doll’s house and three yards of some new cloth the color of prawns. She bought a dozen bathing suits, a rubber alligator, a travelling chess set of gold and ivory, big linen handkerchiefs for Abe, two chamois leather jackets of kingfisher blue and burning bush from Hermès— bought all these things not a bit like a high-class courtesan buying underwear and jewels, which were after all professional equipment and insurance—but with an entirely different point of view. Nicole was the product of much ingenuity and toil. For her sake trains began their run at Chicago and traversed the round belly of the continent to California; chicle factories fumed and link belts grew link by link in factories; men mixed toothpaste in vats and drew mouthwash out of copper hogsheads; girls canned tomatoes quickly in August or worked rudely at the Five-and-Tens on Christmas Eve; half-breed Indians toiled on Brazilian coffee plantations and dreamers were muscled out of patent rights in new tractors—these were some of the people who gave a tithe to Nicole, and as the whole system swayed and thundered onward it lent a feverish bloom to such processes of hers as wholesale buying, like the flush of a fireman’s face holding his post before a spreading blaze. She illustrated very simple principles, containing in herself her own doom, but illustrated them so accurately that there was grace in the procedure, and presently Rosemary would try to imitate it.

在尼科尔的指点下，萝丝玛丽用自己的钱买了两套衣服，两顶帽子和四双鞋子。尼科尔按照一份有两张纸的长长的清单采购物品，另外还买了陈列在橱窗里的东西。她买下喜欢的东西，未必都是她自己要用的，她买来是当作礼物送给朋友的。她买了一些彩色的珠子、几块海滩上用的折叠软垫、一些人造花、蜂蜜、一张专供客人用的床、几只包、几条围巾、几只鹦鹉、可摆在玩具房间中的袖珍物品及三码长的对虾色的某种新式布料。她还买了一打泳装、一条橡皮鳄鱼、一副黄金和象牙制成的旅行象棋、给艾贝的大号亚麻手帕、两件羚羊皮夹克，皮夹克的颜色是那种翠鸟灰，皮毛是大红的，这两件皮夹克是从赫尔墨斯商店买来的——她买下这些东西并不能与一个高级妓女的采购相提并论，后者购买内衣和珠宝，说到底是购买职业装备或者说买保险——而尼科尔的采购则是出于一种截然不同的考虑。尼科尔是才智和辛劳的产物。为了她，火车从芝加哥出发，穿过大陆丰腴的腹地，抵达加利福尼亚；胶姆糖工厂在冒烟，工厂的传送带连续运转着；男人们在缸里搅拌牙膏，从铜制的桶里汲取漱口剂；姑娘们在八月里麻利地装着番茄罐头，或在圣诞夜的杂货店里忙得七荤八素；印第安混血儿在巴西的咖啡种植园里辛勤劳作，幻想家不再享有新型拖拉机的专利权了——这只是向尼科尔进贡的一部分人，随着整个体制轰轰隆隆不可一世地向前推进，就给像尼科尔这样进行大量采购的行为推波助澜，那种买卖的亢奋不下于一个面对大火坚守岗位的消防队员的满脸红光。她体现了一些非常朴素的原则，这些原则掩盖了她本人的可悲命运。她对这些原则的体现是如此确切，以致这种买卖行为也显得优雅起来，而现在萝丝玛丽也竭力要加以仿效了。

"Good night, dear Dick." Mary smiled as if she were going to be perfectly happy sitting there on the almost deserted boat. She was a brave, hopeful woman and she was following her husband somewhere, changing herself to this kind of person or that, without being able to lead him a step out of his path, and sometimes realizing with discouragement how deep in him the guarded secret of her direction lay. And yet an air of luck clung about her, as if she were a sort of token … .

“晚安，亲爱的迪克。”玛丽微笑着，好像她坐在这条空荡荡的船上会十分地快活。她是个勇敢的、有前途的女子，从某些方面来说她追随她的丈夫，改变自己来适应这种人或那种人，而并不能够让他偏离他的道路一步。有时她沮丧地意识到，她秘而不宣的自己的前程已深深地寄放在他的身上了，然而她身上有一股吉祥之气，仿佛她是一种象征…

In the dark cave of the taxi, fragrant with the perfume Rosemary had bought with Nicole, she came close again, clinging to him. He kissed her without enjoying it. He knew that there was passion there, but there was no shadow of it in her eyes or on her mouth; there was a faint spray of champagne on her breath. She clung nearer desperately and once more he kissed her and was chilled by the innocence of her kiss, by the glance that at the moment of contact looked beyond him out into the darkness of the night, the darkness of the world. She did not know yet that splendor is something in the heart; at the moment when she realized that and melted into the passion of the universe he could take her without question or regret.

昏暗的出租车里充溢着香水的芬芳，她用的正是她和尼科尔一起买的那种香水，她又挪近一些，身体依偎着他。他吻了她，但并不觉得欣喜。他知道这里面有一种激情，但她的眼睛和嘴唇没有丝毫这种激情的影子，她呼出的气息中有一股淡淡的香槟酒的味道。她紧紧地贴着他，他又吻她。他被她天真无邪的热吻镇住了。此时，他看了一眼窗外，那夜的黑暗，世界的黑暗让他心里生出一丝凉意。她还不明白，爱的辉煌属于心灵。有朝一日她明白了这一点，并融进宇宙的激情之中，那时，他可以无愧无悔地拥有她。

"Good night, child. This is a damn shame. Let's drop it out of the picture." He gave her two lines of hospital patter to go to sleep on. "So many people are going to love you and it might be nice to meet your first love all intact, emotionally too. That's an old-fashioned idea, isn't it?" She looked up at him as he took a step toward the door; she looked at him without the slightest idea as to what was in his head, she saw him take another step in slow motion, turn and look at her again, and she wanted for a moment to hold him and devour him, wanted his mouth, his ears, his coat collar, wanted to surround him and engulf him; she saw his hand fall on the doorknob. Then she gave up and sank back on the bed. When the door closed she got up and went to the mirror, where she began brushing her hair, sniffling a little. One hundred and fifty strokes Rosemary gave it, as usual, then a hundred and fifty more. She brushed it until her arm ached, then she changed arms and went on brushing… 

“晚安，孩子。这真是太遗憾了。事情过去就别放心上了。”他说了这两句医院的口头禅，劝她去睡觉。“会有许多人爱上你的，当你完美无瑕地，包括感情上，迎来你的初恋，该有多好。那是一种旧观念，是吧？”在他向门口跨出一步时，她抬起头来看他。她看着他，丝毫不明白他到底有什么想法。她见他又慢慢地跨出一步，转身看了她一眼。她一时很想抓住他，吞掉他，想要他的嘴、他的耳朵、他的衣领，想要抱住他把他吞吃了。她看见他的手落在门的把手上。这时，她放弃了这个想法，一头倒在床上。当门关上后，她起身走到镜子那儿，开始梳理她的头发，一边微微地抽噎着。萝丝玛丽刷了一百五十下，像往常一样。接着又是一百五十下。她梳着梳着直到手臂发酸，然后又换只手继续流起来……

She woke up cooled and shamed. The sight of her beauty in the mirror did not reassure her but only awakened the ache of yesterday and a letter, forwarded by her mother, from the boy who had taken her to the Yale prom last fall, which announced his presence in Paris was no help—all that seemed far away. She emerged from her room for the ordeal of meeting the Divers weighted with a double trouble. But it was hidden by a sheath as impermeable as Nicole's when they met and went together to a series of fittings. It was consoling, though, when Nicole remarked, apropos of a distraught saleswoman: "Most people think everybody feels about them much more violently than they actually do—they think other people's opinions of them swing through great arcs of approval or disapproval." Yesterday in her expansiveness Rosemary would have resented that remark—to-day in her desire to minimize what had happened she welcomed it eagerly. She admired Nicole for her beauty and her wisdom, and also for the first time in her life she was jealous. Just before leaving Gausse's hotel her mother had said in that casual tone, which Rosemary knew concealed her most significant opinions, that Nicole was a great beauty, with the frank implication that Rosemary was not. This did not bother Rosemary, who had only recently been allowed to learn that she was even personable; so that her prettiness never seemed exactly her own but rather an acquirement, like her French. Nevertheless, in the taxi she looked at Nicole, matching herself against her. There were all the potentialities for romantic love in that lovely body and in the delicate mouth, sometimes tight, sometimes expectantly half open to the world. Nicole had been a beauty as a young girl and she would be a beauty later when her skin stretched tight over her high cheekbones—the essential structure was there. She had been white-Saxon-blonde but she was more beautiful now that her hair had darkened than when it had been like a cloud and more beautiful than she.

她醒来时已经平静下来，同时觉得很羞愧。镜子中娟秀的容貌并没有让她恢复信心，只是触动了昨日的伤痛。她母亲给她转来一封信，是那个去年秋天带她去参加耶鲁班级舞会的男孩写的，说他到了巴黎，然而这封信也不能帮她消除痛苦——所有这些似乎都十分遥远。她走出房间去经受同戴弗夫妇见面的煎熬，心里因双重的烦恼而沉甸甸的。当她们见了面，一起去试穿几套衣服时，她就像尼科尔一样，用坚不可摧的外壳将受伤的心灵包藏起来。只是在尼科尔谈论到一个苦恼的女售货员时，她的痛苦才有稍许缓和。“大多数人认为，人们对他们的看法要比他们实际感觉到的更加强烈——他们认为别人对待他们不是赞同就是反对。”要是处于昨天那种亢奋的心境，萝丝玛丽也许会抱怨这种看法了，但今天她希望把所发生的事淡忘掉，便爽快地接受了。她赞赏尼科尔的美貌和智慧，而且她生平第一次产生了嫉妒。就在要离开戈赛旅馆之前，她母亲以漫不经心的口气说，尼科尔是个大美人。萝丝玛丽知道这种口气实际是大有深意的，说白了也就是萝丝玛丽还不是大美人。这倒并不使萝丝玛丽烦心，她也只是近来才有幸知道她亦有动人之处。所以，她的可爱似乎从来就不是她自身具有的，而倒像她的法语一样，是一种学习的结果。然而在出租车里，她看着尼科尔，并拿自己同厄科尔比较。她那迷人的身段，那时而紧紧抿着，时而满含期望地微微张开的玲珑的嘴唇，有着邂逅浪漫爱情的种种可能性。尼科尔还是个姑娘时就出落成一个大美人了，后来她高颧骨上的脸面绷紧起来，这时她仍是个美人——因为基本的脸架子在那儿。她有撒克逊人的血统，白肤金发。比起她曾有过的比脸面还美的一头云鬓，如今她的头发色泽更深些，然而人却更美了。

They were meeting the others in two minutes, and Rosemary reconstructed herself once more as they got out of the taxi in the Rue Guynemer, across from the Luxembourg Gardens. They were lunching in the Norths' already dismantled apartment high above the green mass of leaves. The day seemed different to Rosemary from the day before—When she saw him face to face their eyes met and brushed like birds' wings. After that everything was all right, everything was wonderful, she knew that he was beginning to fall in love with her. She felt wildly happy, felt the warm sap of emotion being pumped through her body. A cool, clear confidence deepened and sang in her. She scarcely looked at Dick but she knew everything was all right.

他们两分钟后要去会其他人，便在卢森堡公园对面的格尼麦大街下了车，萝丝玛丽使自己振作了起来。他们在诺思夫妇的高居于大片绿叶之上的已拆除设备的公寓里吃饭。这一天对萝丝玛丽来说似乎大不同于前一天——当她面对面地看到他时，他们的目光相遇，犹如鸟的翅膀一掠而过。这以后，一切都正常了，一切都美妙起来了。她知道他开始爱上她了。她感到无比的幸福，感到爱的暖流在全身涌动。一种沉稳、清晰的自信在增长，在心头欢乐地歌唱。她几乎不看迪克，但她知道一切都很顺利。

There she was—the school girl of a year ago, hair down her back and rippling out stiffly like the solid hair of a tanagra figure; there she was—so young and innocent—the product of her mother's loving care; there she was—embodying all the immaturity of the race, cutting a new cardboard paper doll to pass before its empty harlot's mind. She remembered how she had felt in that dress, especially fresh and new under the fresh young silk.

她出现在银幕上——那是一年前的她，一副学生模样。头发朝后流着，有关鬈曲着披散开来，就像一尊塔纳格拉陶俑①的硬挺挺的头发。瞧她——多么年轻，多么天真——这是她母亲精心呵护的结果；瞧她——带着少女全部的稚嫩，又在剪一个纸板洋娃娃，足以表现出纯朴少女之心。她还记得她当时穿着那套衣服时的感觉，尤其是穿着那套色彩鲜艳，新做的绸衣服，觉得神清气爽，兴致勃勃——

Daddy's girl. Was it a 'itty-bitty bravekins and did it suffer? Ooo-ooo-tweet, de tweetest thing, wasn't she dest too tweet? Before her tiny fist the forces of lust and corruption rolled away; nay, the very march of destiny stopped; inevitable became evitable, syllogism, dialectic, all rationality fell away. Women would forget the dirty dishes at home and weep, even within the picture one woman wept so long that she almost stole the film away from Rosemary. She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room, in an aviation port, and during a yacht-race that was only used in two flashes, in a subway and finally in a bathroom. But Rosemary triumphed. Her fineness of character, her courage and steadfastness intruded upon by the vulgarity of the world, and Rosemary showing what it took with a face that had not yet become mask-like—yet it was actually so moving that the emotions of the whole row of people went out to her at intervals during the picture. There was a break once and the light went on and after the chatter of applause Dick said to her sincerely: "I'm simply astounded. You're going to be one of the best actresses on the stage."

老爸的女儿。它是一个小精灵吗？它吃过苦吗？噢——噢，甜蜜的，最甜蜜的小宝贝，她难道不甜蜜吗？在她的小拳头前，淫欲和腐化的力量消失得无影无踪，而且命运的进程停止了，不可避免的成了可避免的，三段论，辩证法，所有的合理性逃逸了。女人在家里忘掉那些脏餐具而哭泣起来，甚至在电影中一个女人哭个不停，差不多喧宾夺主地要把戏从萝丝玛丽那儿抢走了。在耗费大笔资金的一组戏里，她始终哭着。在邓肯-法伊夫餐厅，在机场，在只拍了两个镜头的快艇比赛中，在地铁，最后还在浴室里哭，但萝丝玛丽获胜了。她气质的优雅、她的勇气和镇定尽管会遭到世俗的侵蚀，然而萝丝玛丽用一张还未面具化的脸征服了观众——这部电影也确实感人，以致在放映中，坐在这排位子上的人接二连三地向她传递他们内心的激动。放映中曾有一次停顿，灯亮起来了，一阵掌声过后，迪克真诚地对她说：“我简直吃惊，你会成为银幕上最出色的演员。”
 
They looked at each other at last, murmuring names that were a spell. Softly the two names lingered on the air, died away more slowly than other words, other names, slower than music in the mind.
 
他们最终四目相对，念咒语般地低声呼唤着对方的名字。他俩的名字在夜色中轻柔低回，比其他的字眼，其他的名目留存得更长久，比心中的乐曲更为舒缓。
 
Again the names—then they lurched together as if the taxi had swung them. Her breasts crushed flat against him, her mouth was all new and warm, owned in common. They stopped thinking with an almost painful relief, stopped seeing; they only breathed and sought each other. They were both in the gray gentle world of a mild hangover of fatigue when the nerves relax in bunches like piano strings, and crackle suddenly like wicker chairs. Nerves so raw and tender must surely join other nerves, lips to lips, breast to breast… .
 
又念叨起对方的名字来——随后他们倒在一起，像是汽车颠了他们一下似的。她的胸脯紧贴着他，她的嘴唇是那么鲜嫩温馨，此刻它属于他们俩。他们感到一种几乎是痛苦的畅快，不再想什么，不再看什么。他们只是气息相通，身躯相拥。当全身的神经像钢琴的弦那样渐渐松弛下来，像柳条椅那样突然吱吱嘎嘎发出声响，他们俩都处在一种难以言说的、轻微的疲乏状态之中。此时他们的神经是如此敏感娇嫩，势必要得到对方的呼应，于是，嘴咬着嘴，胸贴着胸……
 
They were still in the happier stage of love. They were full of brave illusions about each other, tremendous illusions, so that the communion of self with self seemed to be on a plane where no other human relations mattered. They both seemed to have arrived there with an extraordinary innocence as though a series of pure accidents had driven them together, so many accidents that at last they were forced to conclude that they were for each other. They had arrived with clean hands, or so it seemed, after no traffic with the merely curious and clandestine.
 
他们仍沉溺于爱的欢欣之中。他们都对对方抱着大胆的幻想，无数的幻想，因而这一个自我与那一个自我的沟通似乎是在一个同其他人类关系不相干的地方进行的。他们似乎不明不白地来到此地，仿佛是一系列纯粹偶然的事件驱使他们走到了一起，竟有这么多偶然事件，以致到最后他们不得不得出结论，他们都是为对方而来的。他们清清白白来到这儿，或者说看起来像是这样，事先并没有仅出于好奇或偷偷相会过。

Although the Divers were honestly apathetic to organized fashion, they were nevertheless too acute to abandon its contemporaneous rhythm and beat—Dick's parties were all concerned with excitement, and a chance breath of fresh night air was the more precious for being experienced in the intervals of the excitement.

The party that night moved with the speed of a slapstick comedy. They were twelve, they were sixteen, they were quartets in separate motors bound on a quick Odyssey over Paris. Everything had been foreseen. People joined them as if by magic, accompanied them as specialists, almost guides, through a phase of the evening, dropped out and were succeeded by other people, so that it appeared as if the freshness of each one had been husbanded for them all day. Rosemary appreciated how different it was from any party in Hollywood, no matter how splendid in scale. There was, among many diversions, the car of the Shah of Persia. Where Dick had commandeered this vehicle, what bribery was employed, these were facts of irrelevance. Rosemary accepted it as merely a new facet of the fabulous, which for two years had filled her life. The car had been built on a special chassis in America. Its wheels were of silver, so was the radiator. The inside of the body was inlaid with innumerable brilliants which would be replaced with true gems by the court jeweller when the car arrived in Teheran the following week. There was only one real seat in back, because the Shah must ride alone, so they took turns riding in it and sitting on the marten fur that covered the floor.

虽然戴弗夫妇对人为的时尚向来兴趣不大，然而他们非常敏锐，不会放过时尚所带来的节奏和韵律——迪克圈子里的人都喜欢热闹，如果在寻欢作乐的空隙有机会呼吸一下夜晚清新的空气就更好了。

快天晚上的聚会仿佛是上演一出滑稽喜剧。先是十二人，后来变成十六人，他们四人一伙开着车在巴黎兜风。人们着了魔似的参与进来，像专家甚至导游一样陪伴着他们，度过晚上的一段时光，随即又消失了踪影，被其他人取代。人们似乎整天都在为这一良宵养精蓄锐。萝丝玛丽由衷地感到这与好莱坞的聚会有多么地不同，尽管后者的规模要宏大得多。有许多的娱乐活动，还有一辆波斯国王的汽车。迪克从哪儿搞来这部车子，用了什么贿赂手段，这些都无关紧要。萝丝玛丽只当它又是一个稀奇玩艺儿，过去两年里，新奇的玩艺她见多了。汽车是在美国产的一种特殊底盘上组装成的。车轮是银制的，散热器也是。车厢里镶嵌了无数的钻石，当这辆车下星期抵达德黑兰①时，这些钻石就会被宫廷珠宝匠用真正的宝石替换。后面只有一个真正的座位，因为国王乘车外出必须一人独坐，所以他们轮流坐进去，在那铺满地板的貉皮上坐坐

But always there was Dick. Rosemary assured the image of her mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as Dick was that night. She compared him with the two Englishmen, whom Abe addressed conscientiously as "Major Hengest and Mr. Horsa," and with the heir to a Scandinavian throne and the novelist just back from Russia, and with Abe, who was desperate and witty, and with Collis Clay, who joined them somewhere and stayed along—and felt there was no comparison. The enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving many varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies of attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on rations, appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his own most personal self for everyone.

但总是离不开迪克。萝丝玛丽可以对她一直带在身边的母亲的肖像保证：她从来，从来没有见过有谁像这天晚上的迪克那样优雅，简直优雅极了。她将迪克同两个英国人相比，艾贝谨慎地称这两个英国人为亨吉斯特少校和霍尔瑟先生。她还将迪克同斯堪的纳维亚的一位王储和某个刚从俄罗斯回来的小说家相比。还同毫无顾忌、诙谐有趣的艾贝相比，同科利斯-克莱相比，他也搀和进来并呆在一起——她觉得他们都比不上他。迪克在整个夜间活动中表现出来的热情和慷慨让她入迷。他具有调动许多不同类型的人的本领，这些人缺乏主动性，像军队的步兵依赖给养那样依赖他的关照。迪克似乎能够毫不费力地这么做，且仍能将最具有个人化的自我奉献给每一个人—

Afterward she remembered the times when she had felt the happiest. The first time was when she and Dick danced together and she felt her beauty sparkling bright against his tall, strong form as they floated, hovering like people in an amusing dream—he turned her here and there with such a delicacy of suggestion that she was like a bright bouquet, a piece of precious cloth being displayed before fifty eyes. There was a moment when they were not dancing at all, simply clinging together. Some time in the early morning they were alone, and her damp powdery young body came up close to him in a crush of tired cloth, and stayed there, crushed against a background of other people's hats and wraps… 

日后她回忆起她感到的那些最幸福的时刻。第一次是她和迪克一起跳舞。他高大健壮，她则妩媚，光彩照人。他们翩翩起舞，犹如在甜蜜的梦幻中倘佯——他带着她满场子转，巧妙地向人暗示，她就像一束艳丽的鲜花，一块华贵的布料展现在那二十五个人眼前。有一刻，他们似乎停下来不再跳舞，只是紧紧地偎依在一起。清晨的某个时辰，他们单独呆着，她汗津津的搽过粉的娇躯紧贴着他，他的衣服被揉得皱巴巴的，他们在挂着别人的帽子和外套的地方拥抱…

She felt a little betrayed and sad, but presently a moving object came into sight. It was a huge horse-chestnut tree in full bloom bound for the Champs Élysées, strapped now into a long truck and simply shaking with laughter—like a lovely person in an undignified position yet confident none the less of being lovely. Looking at it with fascination Rosemary identified herself with it, and laughed cheerfully with it, and everything all at once seemed gorgeous.

她觉得自己有点误入歧途，于是伤感起来，但这时一个活动的场面映人眼帘。这是一棵巨大的七叶树，开满了花，正被运往香榭里舍大街。树虽被缚在一辆长长的卡车上。但枝叶欢快地摆动着——犹如一个高尚的人身处逆境，仍对自己的高尚充满自信。萝丝玛丽出神地看着这棵树，不禁把自己当作这棵树，因而快乐地大笑起来，顷刻之间，一切都显得那么美好。

They stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted down by Abe's gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness. All of them were conscious of the solemn dignity that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary, suggestive and surpassed. But they were frightened at his survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.

这一群人站在那儿，由于艾贝高大的身躯而显得有些不协调。他背对着她们，活像一艘古代大帆船的残骸。他倚仗这高大的身躯来制约他的软弱，他的自我放纵，他的褊狭和他的痛苦。她们都能感受到从他身上透露出来的那种高贵的气质，都清楚他取得的成就，他的成就是断断续续的，有启发性的，当然已被人超越了，但是，她们担惊受怕的还是他尚存的那种意愿，过去这是一种去活的意愿，而如今变成了一种去死的意愿。

Nearby, some Americans were saying good-by in voices that mimicked the cadence of water running into a large old bathtub. Standing in the station, with Paris in back of them, it seemed as if they were vicariously leaning a little over the ocean, already undergoing a sea-change, a shifting about of atoms to form the essential molecule of a new people.

So the well-to-do Americans poured through the station onto the platforms with frank new faces, intelligent, considerate, thoughtless, thought-for. An occasional English face among them seemed sharp and emergent. When there were enough Americans on the platform the first impression of their immaculacy and their money began to fade into a vague racial dusk that hindered and blinded both them and their observers.

不远处，有些美国人在话别，那说话声宛如一只巨大而陈旧的澡盆里的汩汩流水声。置身在车站内，背后就是巴黎，看起来就好像他们不是在车站，而正微微探身面对大海。为造就一个新兴民族，他们正经历一场巨变，一种脱胎换骨。

于是这些有钱的美国人蜂拥进入车站，来到站台，一张张陌生的面孔神态各异，有的坦率，有的聪颖，有的谨慎，有的一副蠢相，有的则莫测高深。他们中间偶尔闪过一张英国人的脸，那么冷峻和匆忙。当站台上充塞着美国人，那么对他们的率直和富裕产生的第一印象便会融进一片模糊的种族的阴影之中，这片阴影挡住了他们和他们的观察者的视线，损害了双方的判断力。

For the first time the mention of her mother annoyed rather than amused Dick. He wanted to sweep away her mother, remove the whole affair from the nursery footing upon which Rosemary persistently established it. But he realized that this impulse was a loss of control—what would become of Rosemary's urge toward him if, for even a moment, he relaxed. He saw, not without panic, that the affair was sliding to rest; it could not stand still, it must go on or go back; for the first time it occurred to him that Rosemary had her hand on the lever more authoritatively than he.

这还是第一次，萝丝玛丽提到她母亲使迪克感到不快而不是高兴。他要抛开她母亲，要整个儿改变这桩风流韵事受某种监护的状态，而萝丝玛丽始终立足于这种状态，但他意识到，这一种冲动是失去控制的表现——萝丝玛丽对他的欲求会发展到什么程度，如果他放松，哪怕只是一会儿。他不无惊慌地看出，这件事渐渐地平稳下来，但这种事是不可能静止不变的，它要么继续，要么后退。他也第一次意识到，要说掌握这种事的操纵杆，萝丝玛丽比他更有权威性。
 
He knew that what he was now doing marked a turning point in his life—it was out of line with everything that had preceded it—even out of line with what effect he might hope to produce upon Rosemary. Rosemary saw him always as a model of correctness—his presence walking around this block was an intrusion. But Dick's necessity of behaving as he did was a projection of some submerged reality: he was compelled to walk there, or stand there, his shirt-sleeve fitting his wrist and his coat sleeve encasing his shirt-sleeve like a sleeve valve, his collar molded plastically to his neck, his red hair cut exactly, his hand holding his small briefcase like a dandy—just as another man once found it necessary to stand in front of a church in Ferrara, in sackcloth and ashes. Dick was paying some tribute to things unforgotten, unshriven, unexpurgated.
 
他知道他眼下所做的将是他生活中一个转折点——它不同于先前所做的一切，甚至也不同于他希望在萝丝玛丽身上产生的结果。萝丝玛丽总是把他视作正确的榜样——他此刻在这段地区走来走去简直是一种侵犯，但迪克这一行为的必要性，是某种内部现实的反映：他是情不自禁地去那儿，或站在那儿的——他的衬衫袖口正好垂到手腕，他外衣的袖口像阀门似的正好包住衬衫袖口，衣服的衣领贴着他的脖颈；他的头发修剪整齐，他手拎着小巧的公文包，俨然一个花花公子——就像是另一个人觉得有必要站在费拉拉①的教堂前，悲痛地仟悔。或许迪克正在对尚未忘怀、尚未忏悔、尚未处理的事情祷告吧——

After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact. It was just the sort of thing that was likely to happen to him when he was in the mood of not wanting to see any one. So rigidly did he sometimes guard his exposed self-consciousness that frequently he defeated his own purposes; as an actor who underplays a part sets up a craning forward, a stimulated emotional attention in an audience, and seems to create in others an ability to bridge the gap he has left open. Similarly we are seldom sorry for those who need and crave our pity—we reserve this for those who, by other means, make us exercise the abstract function of pity.

他在那儿逗留了三刻钟，之后他突然与别人有了接触，这正是那种对他来说极有可能发生的事，尤其当他处于不想见任何人的心境。他有时固执地保护着他易受伤害的自我意识，以致他常常挫败自己的意图。这就像一个演技拙劣的演员，故意弄出一个悬念，以刺激观众的情感，吸引他们的注意，以便使他人产生一种能力来填补他留下的空白。同样，我们很少对需要和乞求我们怜悯的人表示同情——我们将同情保留给那些人，他们以不同的方式让我们体验到怜悯的抽象功能。

Back at two o'clock in the Roi George corridor the beauty of Nicole had been to the beauty of Rosemary as the beauty of Leonardo's girl was to that of the girl of an illustrator. Dick moved on through the rain, demoniac and frightened, the passions of many men inside him and nothing simple that he could see.

回想下午两点时，在乔治王旅馆的阳台上，尼科尔的美丽辉映着萝丝玛丽的美丽，犹如达-芬奇的蒙娜丽莎对应插图画家笔下的美人。迪克在雨中前行，心神狂乱，惊惧不定，他内心翻腾着许多男子的激情，他明白事情不会简单。
 
Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of. She was now what is sometimes called a "little wild thing"—by twenty-four full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle—counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.

萝丝玛丽怀着一种无人知晓的柔情打开了房门。她现在成了人们有时所说的一个“狂热的小东西”——已经有二十四小时了，她还有点魂不守舍。她全力应付周边的混乱，仿佛她的命运就是一副拼图玩具——清点收益，清点希望，指派迪克和尼科尔、她母亲，还有她昨天认识的那个导游，就像是立足于命运的丝线上。

When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.

当迪克敲门时，她刚穿戴整齐，一边注视着窗外的雨，一边想起一首小诗和贝弗利希尔斯①积满雨水的水沟。她打开门，看见他像往常一样。在她眼里，他始终如一，像一尊天神，这就如同在年轻人看来，一个老年人永远是刻板僵化的。迪克见到她则产生了一种难以抑制的失望。他没有马上对她的坦然和甜甜的微笑做出反应，她身体极为匀称，此时就像一个花蕾，日后必定绽放出一朵花花来。他注意到通向浴室的地毯上有她湿湿的一溜脚印——

"Miss Television," he said with a lightness he did not feel. He put his gloves, his brief-case on the dressing-table, his stick against the wall. His chin dominated the lines of pain around his mouth, forcing them up into his forehead and the corner of his eyes, like fear that cannot be shown in public.

"Come and sit on my lap close to me," he said softly, "and let me see about your lovely mouth."
She came over and sat there and while the dripping slowed down outside—drip—dri-i-ip, she laid her lips to the beautiful cold image she had created.

Presently she kissed him several times in the mouth, her face getting big as it came up to him; he had never seen anything so dazzling as the quality of her skin, and since sometimes beauty gives back the images of one's best thoughts he thought of his responsibility about Nicole, and of the responsibility of her being two doors down across the corridor.

"电视小姐。”他故作轻松地打趣道。他把他的手套、公文包放在梳妆台上，手杖靠在墙边。他的下巴控制着他嘴角的痛苦的线条，使它们像个宜表露露的恐惧一样爬上他的额头和眼角。

“过来，坐在我的腿上，”他温柔地说，“让我看看你可爱的小嘴。”

她走过来，坐在他的腿上，此时窗外的雨水渐渐慢下来了——滴答——滴答，她将嘴唇贴在她勾画出来的美丽而又冷漠的形象上。

此时。她在他嘴上吻了几下，她凑向他时，他觉得她的脸那么丰润，他从未见过有什么东西她凝脂般的肌肤那样令人目眩。有时候，美丽使人产生最高尚的思想，他这时就想起了对尼科尔的责任，想起她就可能性在走廊对面隔着两个房门的房间里。

The veranda of the central building was illuminated from open French windows, save where the black shadows of stripling walls and the fantastic shadows of iron chairs slithered down into a gladiola bed. From the figures that shuffled between the rooms Miss Warren emerged first in glimpses and then sharply when she saw him; as she crossed the threshold her face caught the room's last light and brought it outside with her. She walked to a rhythm--all that week there had been singing in her ears, summer songs of ardent skies and wild shade, and with his arrival the singing had become so loud she could have joined in with it.

从敞开着的落地长窗透出的灯光照亮了中心大楼的走廊，只有一条条墙的暗影和铁制椅子的古怪影子叠合着投到菖蒲属植物的花坛上。从那些在房间之间拖着步子行走的人当中，出现了沃伦小姐的身影，先还模模糊糊，随后她看见了迪克，她的身影也十分清晰了。她跨过门槛时，她的脸被房间里射出的光线照亮了。她随身把光线也带到了室外。她走路很有节奏——一个星期来，她耳朵里老是响着歌声，那有着炽热的天空和浓密的树阴的夏日的歌。当他到来时，这歌声是如此的嘹亮，她可以应和着唱出来了。

Within the building a trio broke into Suppe's "Light Cavalry." Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.

　大楼里响起了苏佩①的三重奏《轻骑兵》。尼科尔乘机站起身来，她年轻美丽的身体给迪克留下越来越强烈的印象。他顿时心潮澎湃。她微笑起来，这是一种动人的孩子般的笑，就像世界上所有那些失落了的青春一般可爱—
 
 Her cream-colored dress, alternately blue or gray as they walked, and her very blonde hair, dazzled Dick--whenever he turned toward her she was smiling a little, her face lighting up like an angel's when they came into the range of a roadside arc. She thanked him for everything, rather as if he had taken her to some party, and as Dick became less and less certain of his relation to her, her confidence increased--there was that excitement about her that seemed to reflect all the excitement of the world.

"I'm not under any restraint at all," she said. "I'll play you two good tunes called 'Wait Till the Cows Come Home' and 'Good-by, Alexander.'"

He was late the next time, a week later, and Nicole was waiting for him at a point in the path which he would pass walking from Franz's house. Her hair drawn back of her ears brushed her shoulders in such a way that the face seemed to have just emerged from it, as if this were the exact moment when she was coming from a wood into clear moonlight. The unknown yielded her up; Dick wished she had no background, that she was just a girl lost with no address save the night from which she had come. They went to the cache where she had left the phonograph, turned a corner by the workshop, climbed a rock, and sat down behind a low wall, facing miles and miles of rolling night.

他们一路散着步，她那套奶色衣服一会现出蓝色，一会又成了灰色。她的一头金发颇使迪克眼花——每当他转过脸来，她总是嫣然一笑。他们走进路边一座拱形凉亭时，她容光焕发，犹如一位天使。她感谢他为她做的一切，就好像是他带她参加了一个晚会。当迪克对他们之间的关系越来越感到没有把握的时候，她的信心却在增长——她神采飞扬，似乎整个世界也骚动兴奋起来。

“我不用受什么约束了，”她说，“我给你放两支好歌，叫做《等到牛群回家》和《再见，亚历山大》。”

一星期后，第二次约会他去晚了，尼科尔在他从弗朗茨家里出来经过的路上等他。她的头发拢在耳后，披在肩上，这式样使她的脸显得像是刚从秀发中钻出来一样，就如同此时此刻，她从树林中走出来到皎洁的月光之下。一个无人知晓的东西造就了她。迪克希望她没有背景，她只是一个不知如何回家的迷途姑娘，有的只是她身后的那片黑暗。他们朝她藏唱片的地方走去，在工作间附近拐个弯，爬上一块岩石，在一堵矮墙后边坐了下来，面对着茫茫夜色。
  
He was enough older than Nicole to take pleasure in her youthful vanities and delights, the way she paused fractionally in front of the hall mirror on leaving the restaurant, so that the incorruptible quicksilver could give her back to herself. He delighted in her stretching out her hands to new octaves now that she found herself beautiful and rich. He tried honestly to divorce her from any obsession that he had stitched her together--glad to see her build up happiness and confidence apart from him; the difficulty was that, eventually, Nicole brought everything to his feet, gifts of sacrificial ambrosia, of worshipping myrtle.

　他比她年长许多，能够欣赏她那种少女的虚荣和乐趣，欣赏她离开餐馆时在门厅的的镜子前驻足顾盼的模样，觉得这种清纯多变的习性能够让她回复她的本来面貌。眼下她知道自己既美丽又富有，因而手舞足蹈起来，迪克也为此感到高兴。他真诚地想要她摆脱任何这种想法，即他挽救了她——乐于看到她无需依赖他而获得幸福和自信。问题在于，尼科尔最终将一切当作祭神用的供品和爱神的木堆放在他跟前。
 
 Her face, ivory gold against the blurred sunset that strove through the rain, had a promise Dick had never seen before: the high cheek-bones, the faintly wan quality, cool rather than feverish, was reminiscent of the frame of a promising colt--a creature whose life did not promise to be only a projection of youth upon a grayer screen, but instead, a true growing; the face would be handsome in middle life; it would be handsome in old age: the essential structure and the economy were there.
 
 在穿过蒙蒙细雨的淡淡的夕阳的映照下。她象牙般白皙的面颊上镀上一层金色，洋溢着一种迪克以前从未见过的希望之光。她高高的颧骨，略显苍白的脸色，沉静而非狂热的神情，这些都让人想起一个充满希望的新手的轮廓——这样一个尤物，其生命所展示的不只是灰色屏幕上的青存的投影，而是一种真正的成长。即使人到中年这张脸还是美丽的，即使垂垂老矣这张脸也不会丑陋，因为有基本的脸架子和匀称的五官在那儿。
 
 The delight in Nicole's face--to be a feather again instead of a plummet, to float and not to drag. She was a carnival to watch--at times primly coy, posing, grimacing and gesturing--sometimes the shadow fell and the dignity of old suffering flowed down into her finger tips. Dick wished himself away from her, fearing that he was a reminder of a world well left behind. He resolved to go to the other hotel.
 
 尼科尔一脸欢欣——成为一片羽毛而不是一只铅锤，往下飘而不是往下坠。她犹如一台让人观赏的狂欢演出，时而拘泥腼腆，装模作样；时而又挤眉弄眼，手舞足蹈——有时，阴影降临，往日受难的高贵气血。直流注到她的指尖。迪克希望自己远远离开她，担心他会让人想起那个抛在身后的世界。他打定主意住另一家旅馆。
 
 The voice fell low, sank into her breast and stretched the tight bodice over her heart as she came up close. He felt the young lips, her body sighing in relief against the arm growing stronger to hold her. There were now no more plans than if Dick had arbitrarily made some indissoluble mixture, with atoms joined and inseparable; you could throw it all out but never again could they fit back into atomic scale. As he held her and tasted her, and as she curved in further and further toward him, with her own lips, new to herself, drowned and engulfed in love, yet solaced and triumphant, he was thankful to have an existence at all, if only as a reflection in her wet eyes.

"My God," he gasped, "you're fun to kiss."

That was talk, but Nicole had a better hold on him now and she held it; she turned coquette and walked away, leaving him as suspended as in the funicular of the afternoon. She felt: There, that'll show him, how conceited; how he could do with me; oh, wasn't it wonderful! I've got him, he's mine. Now in the sequence came flight, but it was all so sweet and new that she dawdled, wanting to draw all of it in.

She shivered suddenly. Two thousand feet below she saw the necklace and bracelet of lights that were Montreux and Vevey, beyond them a dim pendant of Lausanne. From down there somewhere ascended a faint sound of dance music. Nicole was up in her head now, cool as cool, trying to collate the sentimentalities of her childhood, as deliberate as a man getting drunk after battle. But she was still afraid of Dick, who stood near her, leaning, characteristically, against the iron fence that rimmed the horseshoe; and this prompted her to say: "I can remember how I stood waiting for you in the garden--holding all my self in my arms like a basket of flowers. It was that to me anyhow--I thought I was sweet--waiting to hand that basket to you."

He breathed over her shoulder and turned her insistently about; she kissed him several times, her face getting big every time she came close, her hands holding him by the shoulders.

"It's raining hard."

Suddenly there was a booming from the wine slopes across the lake; cannons were shooting at hail-bearing clouds in order to break them. The lights of the promenade went off, went on again. Then the storm came swiftly, first falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents from the mountains and washing loud down the roads and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder, while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel. Mountains and lake disappeared--the hotel crouched amid tumult, chaos and darkness.

她凑上来时，说话声变低了，仿佛沉人她的胸怀，绷紧了她胸口的紧身胸衣。他感到了她娇嫩的嘴唇，她的身体如释重负地靠着他越来越有力地搂住她的手臂。即使迪克配制出某种不可溶解的混合剂，也莫过于眼前这情形了，就像是原子结合在一起，难解难分。你可以将它们统统扔掉，但休想让它们再回复到原子状态。他抱住她，感受着她青春的美好。她越来越紧地依偎着他，她自己的嘴唇也给她带来前所未有的新感觉，她沉浸、淹没在爱的激情之中，然而又显得志得意满。他则为能遭遇这样一种激情而感到庆幸，虽然这只是从她湿润的眼中反映出来的。

　　“天哪，”他喘口气说，“跟你亲吻真是美妙。”

　　这还中听，但尼科尔此时占了他的上风，她抓住这个机会。她卖弄风情似的转身走开，就像今天下午在缆车站一样，撇下他一脸茫然。她感到，这样就可以向他表明，他多么自负，他如何能配得上我。哦，这难道不是很美妙吗？我得到了他，他是我的。此时，她自然是飘飘然了，但这一切是多么地甜蜜和新鲜，她不禁要流连再三，恨不得全部纳入胸怀。

　　她猛地打了个冷战。她眺望着两千英尺远的山下灯火闪烁，犹如发光的项链和手镯的，那是蒙特勒和沃韦市。在它们后面，朦胧的是像挂件似的洛桑市。山下隐约传来舞会的音乐声。尼科尔打定主意，冷静下来，想要审视一下童年时的多愁善感，显得像一个打完架的人喝得酩酊大醉那样潇潇洒洒，但她仍然惧怕迪克，他就站在她身边，以一种独特的方式倚在马蹄形小径围起来的铁栏杆上。她见此情景便说，“我能记得我当时是怎样站在花园里等候你的——我的整个生命，如同一篮鲜花，被我捧在怀里。不管怎样，我那时就是这样的心情——我觉得，我一片真情——等着把花篮献给你。”

　　他吻着她的肩膀，执拗地要她转过身来。她一连吻了他几次，每当她凑上来，她的脸就越加丰腴起来，她搂着他的双肩。

　　“雨下大了。”

　　突然，湖对面暗红色的山坡上传来一声轰响，人们正在向酝酿冰雹的云层开炮，以便驱散它们。他们散步的地方的灯灭了一下，又亮了起来。这时，暴风雨急速地卷了过来，先是从天上倾泻而下，随后挨着山洪奔腾而来，淹没了道路，灌满了石砌的沟渠。天空一片漆黑、异常恐怖，丝状闪电划破夜空，隆隆雷声震天动地。形态狰狞的乱云掠过旅馆。山峰和湖泊都湮没了——旅馆蜷缩在喧闹、混乱和黑暗之中。
  
Baby was a tall, fine-looking woman, deeply engaged in being almost thirty. Symptomatically she had pulled two men with her from London, one scarcely down from Cambridge, one old and hard with Victorian lecheries. Baby had certain spinsters' characteristics—she was alien from touch, she started if she was touched suddenly, and such lingering touches as kisses and embraces slipped directly through the flesh into the forefront of her consciousness. She made few gestures with her trunk, her body proper—instead, she stamped her foot and tossed her head in almost an old-fashioned way. She relished the foretaste of death, prefigured by the catastrophes of friends—persistently she clung to the idea of Nicole's tragic destiny.

巴比是个身材修长，面容姣好的女子，有着快到三十岁年龄的种种气象。她显然从伦敦拉了两个男子跟着她，一个刚从剑桥来，一个则是有维多利亚遗风的老古板。巴比有老处女的一些特性——她不习惯被人触摸，要是有人突然碰了她一下，她会惊跳起来，像接吻和拥抱这类缠绵的接触，会通过皮肉直接传导到她的意识的表层，她很少用她的身体做出合适的姿态——相反，她几乎用一种老派的方式跺脚和晃头。她津津乐道朋友们因不幸而预尝到死亡的滋味——她坚持认为尼科尔的悲剧是她的命。

He was forty. Upon his healthy maturity reposed a set of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the broken rich whom he re-educated. His scientific heredity might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. At the hotel Baby Warren made a quick examination of him, and failing to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized one another, treated him thereafter with her second manner. Nicole was always a little afraid of him. Dick liked him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.

他四十岁，有健康成熟的外表，也有一套讨人喜欢的体面的处世方式，然而，他最感到自在的还是某种平稳的安定状态，在这种状态下，他可以鄙视那些他给予再教育的精神崩溃的富人。他的科学禀赋也许可以给他拓展更宽广的世界，但他似乎有意选择下层社会作为立足点，他择偶的行为就表明了这种选择。在旅馆，巴比-沃伦将他草草地审视了一番，没有发现任何值得敬重的特征，也没有找到特权阶层彼此认可的那种更为雅致的美德或谦恭有礼的举止，因而，她把他当作二等人物来对待。尼科尔总有点怕他。迪克喜欢他，就像喜欢朋友一样，对他毫无保留。

As he sat on the side of his bed, he felt the room, the house and the night as empty. In the next room Nicole muttered something desolate and he felt sorry for whatever loneliness she was feeling in her sleep. For him time stood still and then every few years accelerated in a rush, like the quick re-wind of a film, but for Nicole the years slipped away by clock and calendar and birthday, with the added poignance of her perishable beauty.

他坐在床边，觉得这房间，整幢房子，连同黑夜是一片虚空。隔壁房间，尼科尔发出一阵凄凉的嘟哝声。他为她睡梦中感受到的孤苦无助而难过。他觉得时间停滞了，接着每过几年，时间又冲刺般地加速起来，犹如电影的快速倒片一般。而对尼科尔来说，岁月是通过钟表、日历和生日消逝的，而与日俱增的是对美貌已去的哀伤。

Even this past year and a half on the Zugersee seemed wasted time for her, the seasons marked only by the workmen on the road turning pink in May, brown in July, black in September, white again in Spring. She had come out of her first illness alive with new hopes, expecting so much, yet deprived of any subsistence except Dick, bringing up children she could only pretend gently to love, guided orphans. The people she liked, rebels mostly, disturbed her and were bad for her—she sought in them the vitality that had made them independent or creative or rugged, sought in vain—for their secrets were buried deep in childhood struggles they had forgotten. They were more interested in Nicole's exterior harmony and charm, the other face of her illness. She led a lonely life owning Dick who did not want to be owned.

Many times he had tried unsuccessfully to let go his hold on her. They had many fine times together, fine talks between the loves of the white nights, but always when he turned away from her into himself he left her holding Nothing in her hands and staring at it, calling it many names, but knowing it was only the hope that he would come back soon.

即使对在楚格湖的这一年半的生活，她也觉得是虚度时光，只有走在路上的工人的衣着才稍许表现出季节的变换：他们五月穿粉红色衣服，七月是棕色，九月黑色，春天时又穿上白色衣服。她怀着新的希望，挺过了第一次的发病，心中有着许多的期盼，然而除了迪克，任何维系生存的东西都被剥夺了。抚养孩子，她也只是装出疼爱的样子，只当他们是被指导的孤儿。她喜欢的人，多半是一些放荡不羁的人，他们打扰她的生活，对她并无好处——她在他们身上寻找那曾使他们具有独立精神或创造才能或坚强意志的生命活力，但这种寻找是徒劳的——因为他们的秘密已深埋在他们已经忘却的童年时的斗争中了。他们对尼科尔的外表的和谐和风度更感兴趣，这恰恰是她病情的一个方面。尽管她拥有着不愿被别人拥有的迪克，但她仍过着孤寂的生活。

他有几次想放手不去管她，但都没有成功。他们在一起度过了许多美好时光，曾有多少个不眠之夜娓娓长谈，但每次他转身离她而去，留给她的只是手中的虚幻，可以凝视它，呼唤它，但她知道，这只是一种希望，希望他很快就回来。

"That's all." With disgust he heard himself lying, but here and now the vastness of the subject could only be compressed into a lie. "Outside of that there's only confusion and chaos. I won't lecture to you—we have too acute a realization of your physical suffering. But it's only by meeting the problems of every day, no matter how trifling and boring they seem, that you can make things drop back into place again. After that—perhaps you'll be able again to examine—"

He had slowed up to avoid the inevitable end of his thought: "—the frontiers of consciousness." The frontiers that artists must explore were not for her, ever. She was fine-spun, inbred—eventually she might find rest in some quiet mysticism. Exploration was for those with a measure of peasant blood, those with big thighs and thick ankles who could take punishment as they took bread and salt, on every inch of flesh and spirit.

—Not for you, he almost said. It's too tough a game for you.

Yet in the awful majesty of her pain he went out to her unreservedly, almost sexually. He wanted to gather her up in his arms, as he so often had Nicole, and cherish even her mistakes, so deeply were they part of her. The orange light through the drawn blind, the sarcophagus of her figure on the bed, the spot of face, the voice searching the vacuity of her illness and finding only remote abstractions.

“就这些。”他讨厌自己说谎，但此时此刻，这话题纵使能说上千言万语也只能压缩成一句谎话。“除此以外，只有糊涂和混乱。我不想教训你——我们非常清楚你身体受的痛苦，但只有面对每天会有的问题，不论这些问题多么琐碎和乏味，你才能重新回到原来的状态。此后——也许你就能再次审视——”

他慢慢地说，以免把话一下子说完，“——意识的边缘。”艺术家必须探索的意识边缘从来与她无缘。她过于琐碎，心胸狭窄——她最终可能会在某种宁静的神秘主义那里找到归宿。探索精神适合那些具有庄稼汉的血气的，五大三粗的人，他们可以像吃面包和盐那样承受每一寸肌肤和精神上的刑罚——
  
这不适合你，他几乎要说出口来。这玩艺对你来说太艰难了。

但在她那种令人敬畏的深厚的痛苦面前，他又对她满怀同情，几乎是一种怜爱之情。他想把她搂在怀里，就像他常常搂住尼科尔一样，他甚至欣赏她的缺陷，因为这缺陷是深藏于她体内的一部分。橙黄色的光线透过窗帘，照到床上她那犹如石棺般的躯体，她的脸庞，她的声音好像在探究她疾病背后的那片虚空，所得到的只是一片虚无缥缈的思绪。
 
A wave of agony went over him. It was awful that such a fine tower should not be erected, only suspended, suspended from him. Up to a point that was right: men were for that, beam and idea, girder and logarithm; but somehow Dick and Nicole had become one and equal, not opposite and complementary; she was Dick too, the drought in the marrow of his bones. He could not watch her disintegrations without participating in them. His intuition rilled out of him as tenderness and compassion—he could only take the characteristically modern course, to interpose—he would get a nurse from Zurich, to take her over to-night.

他感到一阵揪心的痛楚，这多可怕。一个如此娇美的身躯竟然站立不住，只能吊着，吊在他身上。在一定程度上这又是对的，男人就得这样：挑大梁、拿主意、当家理财。然而在某种意义上，迪克和尼科尔已成为一体的、平等的，既不是对立的，又不是互补的。她就是迪克，是他骨子里的伤痛，他不可能旁观她精神崩溃而无动于衷，他天生的温情和怜悯从心底汩汩流出——他只能采取具有现代特征的步骤：干预疗法——他打算从苏黎世雇一个护士，今晚就照料她。

Dick tried to rest—the struggle would come presently at home and he might have to sit a long time, restating the universe for her. A "schizophrêne" is well named as a split personality—Nicole was alternately a person to whom nothing need be explained and one to whom nothing could be explained. It was necessary to treat her with active and affirmative insistence, keeping the road to reality always open, making the road to escape harder going. But the brilliance, the versatility of madness is akin to the resourcefulness of water seeping through, over and around a dike. It requires the united front of many people to work against it. He felt it necessary that this time Nicole cure herself; he wanted to wait until she remembered the other times, and revolted from them. In a tired way, he planned that they would again resume the régime relaxed a year before.

迪克想要歇一会——他知道一回家就会有争执，他也许要花费很多时间，把事情整个儿向她细细解释。一个“精神分裂症患者”有理由被称为人格分裂者——尼科尔是这样一个人，要么无需解释，要么无法解释，所以需要以一种积极和肯定的持之以恒的方式对待她，对她现实的道路永远敞开，使逃避之路难以通行。然而伴随着疯狂而出现的才思敏捷，多才多艺就如同丰沛的雨水渗进、漫过和冲刷着堤坝。这需要许多人的齐心协力的配合。他觉得这一次尼科尔需要自我治疗。他准备等待，直到她回忆起先前的经历并感到厌恶。他煞费苦心地筹划，想重新采用一年前放松下来的饮食节制疗法。

Now she lowered the lights for love. Why else should she want to shut off his view of her? He sent his words to her like letters, as though they left him some time before they reached her.

"Hard to sit here and be close to you, and not kiss you." Then they kissed passionately in the centre of the floor. She pressed against him, and went back to her chair.

It could not go on being merely pleasant in the room. Forward or backward; when the phone rang once more he strolled into the bedchamber and lay down on her bed, opening Albert McKisco's novel. Presently Rosemary came in and sat beside him.
"You have the longest eyelashes," she remarked.
"We are now back at the Junior Prom. Among those present are Miss Rosemary Hoyt, the eyelash fancier—"

She kissed him and he pulled her down so that they lay side by side, and then they kissed till they were both breathless. Her breathing was young and eager and exciting. Her lips were faintly chapped but soft in the corners.
When they were still limbs and feet and clothes, struggles of his arms and back, and her throat and breasts, she whispered, "No, not now—those things are rhythmic."

Disciplined he crushed his passion into a corner of his mind, but bearing up her fragility on his arms until she was poised half a foot above him, he said lightly:
"Darling—that doesn't matter."
Her face had changed with his looking up at it; there was the eternal moonlight in it.
"That would be poetic justice if it should be you," she said. She twisted away from him, walked to the mirror, and boxed her disarranged hair with her hands. Presently she drew a chair close to the bed and stroked his cheek.

她把灯光调暗些，以便于谈情说爱。她为什么不让他好好看看她呢？他说起话来就像是把一个个字母送她耳朵里，好像这些宇母要花些时间才能到达她那儿。

　　“坐在这儿，又靠得这么近，真想吻吻你。”接着他们站在房间中央热烈地亲吻起来。她紧挨着他回到自己的椅子上。

　　仅仅在客厅里亲热是不够的。要么前进，要么后退。当电话又一次响起时，他踅进了卧室，躺倒在她的床上，打开艾伯特-麦基斯克的小说。萝丝玛丽走进来，坐在他的身边。

　　“你的睫毛真长。”她说。

　　“我们现在是在大学三年级生举办的舞会上，出席舞会的是萝丝玛丽-霍伊特小姐，她是个眼睫毛迷——”

　　她吻了他，他把她拉下来，他们躺在一起，又亲吻起来。她的呼吸透出青春气息，显得急迫和兴奋。她的嘴唇有些粗糙，但口角柔软。

　　他们仍和衣搂抱着。他手脚忙乱，她气喘吁吁，胸脯起伏，低声说，“不，现在不行——那些事要慢慢来。”

　　他克制着把自己的激情压到大脑的角落里去。他用手臂托起她绵软的身体，一直把她举到离他半英尺高，他轻轻地说：

　　“亲爱的——这没关系。”

　　他仰面看着她，她的脸犹如一轮变幻着的月亮，发出永恒的光辉。

　　“要是你这么做，你会得到善果的。”她说。她从他怀里挣脱出来，走到镜子那儿，用手拍打着凌乱的头发。过后，拖过一把椅子放到床边，她轻轻地抚摸着他的面颊。


Rosemary insisted on treating Dick to lunch next day. They went to a little trattoria kept by an Italian who had worked in America, and ate ham and eggs and waffles. Afterward, they went to the hotel. Dick's discovery that he was not in love with her, nor she with him, had added to rather than diminished his passion for her. Now that he knew he would not enter further into her life, she became the strange woman for him. He supposed many men meant no more than that when they said they were in love—not a wild submergence of soul, a dipping of all colors into an obscuring dye, such as his love for Nicole had been. Certain thoughts about Nicole, that she should die, sink into mental darkness, love another man, made him physically sick.

次日，萝丝玛丽坚持要请迪克吃饭。他们来到一个在美国干过活的意大利人开的餐馆，吃了火腿蛋和华夫饼。餐后，他们回到旅馆。迪克发觉他未曾爱上她，她也并不爱他，但这一发现并未削弱，反而增强了他对她的情欲。既然他明白他不会更深入到她的生活中去，她对他而言变成了一个陌生的女人。他猜想许多人说自己陷入爱河时，所表达的也不过如此——不会是灵魂的沉沦，也不是将所有的色彩浸入到一只染缸中去，就像他对尼科尔的爱那样。他想起了尼科尔，尼科尔应该去死的想法沉入到精神的黑暗中去了，而想到她可能爱上另一个男人，他感到内心阵阵痛楚。
 
Dick's interest in them increased with their ages, now eleven and nine. He managed to reach them over the heads of employees on the principle that both the forcing of children and the fear of forcing them were inadequate substitutes for the long, careful watchfulness, the checking and balancing and reckoning of accounts, to the end that there should be no slip below a certain level of duty. He came to know them much better than Nicole did, and in expansive moods over the wines of several countries he talked and played with them at length. They had that wistful charm, almost sadness, peculiar to children who have learned early not to cry or laugh with abandon; they were apparently moved to no extremes of emotion, but content with a simple regimentation and the simple pleasures allowed them. They lived on the even tenor found advisable in the experience of old families of the Western world, brought up rather than brought out. Dick thought, for example, that nothing was more conducive to the development of observation than compulsory silence.

迪克对孩子的兴趣随他们年龄的增长而增长，眼下他们一个十一岁，一个九岁。他设法采用不同于保姆或家庭教师的方式来和他们相处，他的原则是：苛责和放任都无法代替对他们长期的、细心的观察，无法代替对他们言行的考察、评估和判断，这样才不至于疏忽他们相应承担的责仟。他比尼科尔更了解他们。几杯各国的名酒下肚之后，他便兴致勃勃地同孩子们海阔天空地聊天，尽情地玩乐。他们很安静，甚至有一种忧伤的神情，这是那些很早就懂得不能放声大哭或咧嘴大笑的孩子的特点。他们早就不会流露偏激的情绪，而满足于生活的常规和可以得到的朴素的乐趣。这种平静的生活在西方世界那些古老家族的经历中。被认为是一种可取的生活方式，这恰恰是教养的标志，而不是一时的表现。譬如，迪克就认为，对观察力的发展来说，最有效的莫过于克制性的沉默。

Nicole went on through her garden routine. She left the flowers she cut in designated spots to be brought to the house later by the gardener. Reaching the sea wall she fell into a communicative mood and no one to communicate with; so she stopped and deliberated. She was somewhat shocked at the idea of being interested in another man—but other women have lovers—why not me? In the fine spring morning the inhibitions of the male world disappeared and she reasoned as gaily as a flower, while the wind blew her hair until her head moved with it. Other women have had lovers—the same forces that last night had made her yield to Dick up to the point of death, now kept her head nodding to the wind, content and happy with the logic of, Why shouldn't I?

She sat upon the low wall and looked down upon the sea. But from another sea, the wide swell of fantasy, she had fished out something tangible to lay beside the rest of her loot. If she need not, in her spirit, be forever one with Dick as he had appeared last night, she must be something in addition, not just an image on his mind, condemned to endless parades around the circumference of a medal.

尼科尔在花园里继续做那些照例要做的事情。她将剪下的鲜花放在指定的地方，好让花工稍后拿到屋子里去。她来到海堤，这时她很想找个人说说话，但此处找不到这样一个人。她于是停住脚想起心事来。她有些吃惊，竟然对另一个男人发生了兴趣，但别的女人有情人呀——为什么我不能有呢？在这个清新的春天早晨，有关男人世界的禁忌消失了，在思维的园地，她的心像花儿一样欢乐地开放。风儿吹拂着她的头发，她随风儿晃动着脑袋——别的女人也有情人——正是昨晚使她产生迪克死去的心理的那股力量，此刻又让她陶醉在春风之中，并对那种逻辑感到满意和欣喜，为什么我不能有情人呢？

　　她坐在低矮的海堤上，眺望着大海，但从另一片大海，那波涛汹涌的幻想之海，她钓起了某个实在的东西，放在了她的其他战利品的边上。如果在精神上，她不必始终如一地面对迪克，就像昨晚那样，那她也必然有些额外的东西，不只是他心目中的那个形象，注定要围绕一枚奖章而无休止地旋转。

How good to have things like this, to be worshipped again, to pretend to have a mystery! She had lost two of the great arrogant years in the life of a pretty girl—now she felt like making up for them; she greeted Tommy as if he were one of many men at her feet, walking ahead of him instead of beside him as they crossed the garden toward the market umbrella. Attractive women of nineteen and of twenty-nine are alike in their breezy confidence; on the contrary, the exigent womb of the twenties does not pull the outside world centripetally around itself. The former are ages of insolence, comparable the one to a young cadet, the other to a fighter strutting after combat.

But whereas a girl of nineteen draws her confidence from a surfeit of attention, a woman of twenty-nine is nourished on subtler stuff. Desirous, she chooses her apéritifs wisely, or, content, she enjoys the caviare of potential power. Happily she does not seem, in either case, to anticipate the subsequent years when her insight will often be blurred by panic, by the fear of stopping or the fear of going on. But on the landings of nineteen or twenty-nine she is pretty sure that there are no bears in the hall.

Nicole did not want any vague spiritual romance—she wanted an "affair"; she wanted a change. She realized, thinking with Dick's thoughts, that from a superficial view it was a vulgar business to enter, without emotion, into an indulgence that menaced all of them. On the other hand, she blamed Dick for the immediate situation, and honestly thought that such an experiment might have a therapeutic value. All summer she had been stimulated by watching people do exactly what they were tempted to do and pay no penalty for it—moreover, in spite of her intention of no longer lying to herself, she preferred to consider that she was merely feeling her way and that at any moment she could withdraw… .

这有多美，又受到爱慕追求，又披上了一件神秘的面纱！当她是个如花似玉的女孩时，曾失去了两年宝贵的时光——此刻，她觉得她像是在获得补偿。她欢迎汤米，仿佛他是当年拜倒在她脚下的众多男子中的一个。她走在他前面，而不是走在他身旁。他们穿过花园，朝一把遮阳伞走去。要是一个漂亮女人乐观自信，那十九岁和二十九岁没有什么差别，而且，具有丰富的内心世界的二十九岁的女人不再对外部世界贪得无厌。十九岁少女目空一切，犹如一个军校学生，而二十九岁的女人则可比作凯旋归来的昂首挺胸的战士。

　　一个十九岁少女从引人注目中获得自信，而一个二十九岁的女人的自信则有更深邃的养料。心里蠢蠢欲动，她就明智地选择开胃酒；而感到心满意足，就品尝余味无穷的鱼子酱。幸运的是，无论在哪种情况下，她似乎并不过早地去考虑未来的岁月，生怕她的判断力会因惊恐或患得患失的心理而遭损害，但不论是十九岁，还是二十九岁，在她眼里都不是什么大不了的事情。

　　尼科尔不指望那种朦胧的精神罗曼司——她要的是一次“风流韵事”。她企求来一次变动。她明白，按迪克的想法，以一种肤浅的观点来看，缺乏感情基础而一味放纵情欲，从而使大家遭受到伤害是下作之事。从另一方面看，她将眼下这种状况归咎于迪克。她甚至天真地想，这样一种举动也许会收到治疗的效果。整个夏天，让她深有感触的是，她看到人们恰恰做那些诱惑他们去做的事，而不受任何处罚——更有甚者，尽管她不想再欺骗自己，但倾向于认为，她只是试着走走，而且随时都可以撤下来。

She wandered about the house rather contentedly, resting on her achievement. She was a mischief, and that was a satisfaction; no longer was she a huntress of corralled game. Yesterday came back to her now in innumerable detail—detail that began to overlay her memory of similar moments when her love for Dick was fresh and intact. She began to slight that love, so that it seemed to have been tinged with sentimental habit from the first. With the opportunistic memory of women she scarcely recalled how she had felt when she and Dick had possessed each other in secret places around the corners of the world, during the month before they were married. Just so had she lied to Tommy last night, swearing to him that never before had she so entirely, so completely, so utterly… .

… then remorse for this moment of betrayal, which so cavalierly belittled a decade of her life, turned her walk toward Dick's sanctuary.

Approaching noiselessly she saw him behind his cottage, sitting in a steamer chair by the cliff wall, and for a moment she regarded him silently. He was thinking, he was living a world completely his own and in the small motions of his face, the brow raised or lowered, the eyes narrowed or widened, the lips set and reset, the play of his hands, she saw him progress from phase to phase of his own story spinning out inside him, his own, not hers. Once he clenched his fists and leaned forward, once it brought into his face an expression of torment and despair—when this passed its stamp lingered in his eyes. For almost the first time in her life she was sorry for him—it is hard for those who have once been mentally afflicted to be sorry for those who are well, and though Nicole often paid lip service to the fact that he had led her back to the world she had forfeited, she had thought of him really as an inexhaustible energy, incapable of fatigue—she forgot the troubles she caused him at the moment when she forgot the troubles of her own that had prompted her. That he no longer controlled her—did he know that? Had he willed it all?—she felt as sorry for him as she had sometimes felt for Abe North and his ignoble destiny, sorry as for the helplessness of infants and the old.

她闲闲地在家里溜达，对自己所做的感到满意。她成了个惹是生非者，这倒也不错。她不再是栏内捕兽游戏的一个女猎手了。昨日的事回想起来历历在目——无数的细节开始同记忆中相似的经历重叠起来，那时，她对迪克的爱情清新、纯洁。现在她开始鄙视那样的爱情。在她看来，这种爱情一开始就同她多愁善感的习性牵扯在一起。女性的回忆总是有选择性的，因而她很少去回想结婚前几个月里，当她和迪克周游世界，在那些陌生的地方互相拥抱的时候，她到底有怎样的感受。出于同样的心理，她昨夜也对汤米撒了谎。她对他申明：她以前从未像这样整个地、全部地、彻底地爱一个人…

……她为感情的背叛，为一笔抹煞她这十多年的生活而感到内疚，便转身向迪克的庇护所走去。

　　她悄无声息地走过去，看见他在那座小房舍后边，坐在崖壁前的一张躺椅上。她静静地看了他一会。他在想心事，沉浸在完全属于他自己的世界里，脸上的肌肉微微抽动，眉毛扬起又落下，眼睛瞪大又眯起，嘴唇张开又抿上，双手无意识地动着。她知道他在心里一步一步地编织他自己，而不是她的故事。他一度握紧双拳，身体前倾，脸上还显出痛苦和绝望的表情——当这种表情从脸上消失后仍在他的目光里淹留不去。她几乎是有生以来第一次要为他感到难过了——确实很难设想，一个曾经精神失常的人去同情一个心智健全的人。虽然尼科尔常常念叨着是他帮她找回了丢失的世界，但她实际上把他看作是一种永不衰竭的力量，永远精力充沛，她忘了当她不记得自己得病的那些麻烦时期给他造成的麻烦。他不再能控制她了，他知道这一点吗？这一切是他愿意看到的吗？她为他感到难过，正如她有时为艾贝-诺思和他的可悲命运感到难过一样，为那些孤苦无助的孩子和老人难过一样。

While he did not answer she began to feel the old hypnotism of his intelligence, sometimes exercised without power but always with substrata of truth under truth which she could not break or even crack. Again she struggled with it, fighting him with her small, fine eyes, with the plush arrogance of a top dog, with her nascent transference to another man, with the accumulated resentment of years; she fought him with her money and her faith that her sister disliked him and was behind her now; with the thought of the new enemies he was making with his bitterness, with her quick guile against his wine-ing and dine-ing slowness, her health and beauty against his physical deterioration, her unscrupulousness against his moralities—for this inner battle she used even her weaknesses—fighting bravely and courageously with the old cans and crockery and bottles, empty receptacles of her expiated sins, outrages, mistakes. And suddenly, in the space of two minutes she achieved her victory and justified herself to herself without lie or subterfuge, cut the cord forever. Then she walked, weak in the legs, and sobbing coolly, toward the household that was hers at last.


他没吭声，她开始感觉到他的才智曾对她有过的催眠般的作用，这种才智有时无需借助权力就能产生作用，但总是伴随着一层深一层地对真相的揭示，这种真相，她无法砸碎，甚至都不能稍稍打开一条裂缝。她再次对他的才智进行反抗，用她细巧秀丽的眼睛，用一个优胜者极度的傲慢，用她刚萌生的移情别恋，用积累多年的怨愤同他较量；用她的金钱以及她相信她姐姐不喜欢他而支持她，用他因刻薄而招来新的对头这些想法同他较量；用她机敏的手段来对付他慢吞吞的饮酒吃饭；用她的健康和美丽来对付他身体的衰老；用她的肆无忌惮来对付他的道德信条——在这场内心的战斗中，她不惜以她的弱点为武器——犹如用破旧的瓶瓶罐罐，她用她已经受到惩罚的罪过、劣迹和错误来做勇敢无畏的抗击。在短短两分钟的时间里，她立马取得了胜利，不是用撒谎，无需要花招，她就自我证明了自己行为的正当合理，鸡眼一劳永逸地被挖掉了。随后，她抱着无力的双腿，微微啜泣着朝最终是她的房子走去。

He would have to go fix this thing that he didn't care a damn about, because it had early become a habit to be loved, perhaps from the moment when he had realized that he was the last hope of a decaying clan.

Wanting above all to be brave and kind, he had wanted, even more than that, to be loved. So it had been. So it would ever be, he saw, simultaneously with the slow archaic tinkle from the phone box as he rang off.

他翻身起床，对他所了解的情况做了一番考虑，这时，他的自我意识使他确信，他可以接手来解决这件事——往日那种急公好义的行为产生的致命的愉悦感，强大的诱惑力，连同“我来！”的大声喊叫，从内心里扫过。他必须去处理这件与他毫不相干的事情。因为去讨人喜欢是他早年养成的一个习惯，也许从他意识到他是一个破落家族的最后一丝希望的时候就开始了。在一个几乎完全类似的场合，这场合可回溯到在苏黎世湖的多姆勒诊所，由于意识到这种习惯的力量，他便做出决定，选择了奥菲利娅①，端起这杯酣蜜的毒酒喝了下去。首先，他要表现得勇敢、善良，尤为重要的是，要讨人喜欢。过去是这样，以后也会是这样。从他挂上话筒，电话机发出缓慢而古老的丁零一声时，他就明白了——
